Or does Pop sell out the moment it merges with the mainstream, and as a result only helps to confirm the status quo? Or are we talking about a false dichotomy here? Might Pop follow a cultural technique that could be called â€˜subversive affirmation,â€™ a gesture of false yes-saying that would lead us from Diogenes in the barrel to Till Eulenspiegel, and, as a final consequence, right into the midst of the 20th century, to the Munich activists against the German rearmament who rallied under the slogan: â€œWe want more bombs!â€ Or does that form of subversion lie in the past already as a mere object of nostalgia? Would Pop need to develop new means of subver!sion because the famous gap between high-brow and low-brow that Leslie Fiedler described in his seminal Pop essay â€œCross the border â€"" bridge the gapâ€ has, since then, been turned into a landfill?; Are there ways to conceptualize relationships between German and transnational Pop literature?; Is there a connection between Bret Easton Ellis's leitmotif from Glamorama: â€œLet's slide down the surface of things,â€ and Andy Warhol's â€œTrying to figure out what was happening â€"" and taping it all?â€ Is Pop directed against the hermeneutics of depth (tiefenhermeneutische Sinnsuche) â€"" or does it try to encourage just such a hermeneutics by providing excessively blank and polished surfaces that will, as a result, sparkle back reflections? Is Pop's obsession with surfaces and its reluctance to penetrate to the meaning or nature of an alleged dimension below the surface sufficiently explained by its attachment to the fleetingness and the perishability of the moment, so inimitably pointed to by the Flaming Lips: â€œAll we have is now / All we've ever had was now / All we have is now / All we'll ever have is now?; Could Pop be seen as a monstrous archive of â€œHow We Used to Liveâ€ (Saint Etienne), since it ceaselessly gathers and stores surface material â€"" from Richard Hamilton's Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing? to the detailed hyper-realistic inventories in Glamorama, from Andy Warhol's Disaster paintings to the rhythmically structured patterns of news ticker samples in Andreas Neumeister's 2004 Angela Davis Deletes Her Website? What would be the nature of this archive? And does irony supply a means of escape â€"" because, as Luhmann stated, â€œWhatever we know about our society, or indeed the world in which we live, we know through mass media,â€ thereby suggesting that every word we speak and write is already discursively pre-shaped? But what if we were unremittingly confronted with speech acts as elusively and permanently ironic as Jerry Seinfeldâ€™s â€"" and what about Jarvis Cocker's assertion that â€œIrony is overâ€? Is that irony... again?!; Or have we maybe entered a post-ironic age? Would that mean that Rock (=authenticity & eternity) has finally triumphed over Pop (=irony & transience) â€"" or precisely the opposite?; Is there a way to describe an interface between Pop/music and literature? It has been argued that authors such as Rainald Goetz, Kathrin RÃ¶ggla, Andreas Neumeister, or Thomas Meinecke have all employed techniques derived from DJ culture to structure or inform their narratives. How could we define that interface? Can the frequently observed connection between Beat Writing and Jazz hold as an analogy â€"" the spontaneity of creation, the Bebop speech patterns, the improvisational form? Or would it be worthwhile to go back even further and look at the Romantics, who, according to Steven Paul Scher and others, aspired to write verbal music, since only music could transcend the materiality of the moment?; On a different note, how could Pop's odd obsession with the (ironic?) valorization of terrorist symbols be explained? Could the RAF (Rote Armee Fraktion) be termed a 'Pop phenomenon' because in it we find a combination of glamour and radicality, style and an outlaw image? Prada Meinhof? Terrorist chique? And as a final consequence: models as assassins (as in Bret Easton Ellis's Glamorama)? What role do style and aesthetics play? Why can Che Guevara be Pop â€"" but Reagan can't? Does that mean Pop is politically biased? Why is Einstein Pop? Was it his corona-like hairdo that seemed to follow an electrostatical principle of its own and could be read as a pact between chaos and genius? Was Oscar Wilde Pop? Could Goethe become Pop? And would Schiller be Rock then?; Or is what counts as Pop purely in the eye of the beholder?"

How does this metaphor modify current views of the classic?; How can translation qualify our conceptions of meaning and interpretation of the classics? Can we define translatability without referring to the binary opposition between 'fidelity' and 'infidelity'?; How does translation illustrate the variability of aesthetic, moral, andpolitical standards that underlie the shaping of the canon, ancient andmodern?; Can we redefine the classic by investigating the institutional, culturaland political processes through which it is (re)constructed? Alternatively,does the notion of the classic present a challenge to certainrepresentations of history?; How have translations of classic texts reinforced class, gender, and race divisions? Can they also provide a means of resistance to oppressive political discourses?"
