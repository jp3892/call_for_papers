We invite all who are interested to submit an abstractSince the late 1990s the British gangster film (whose popularity peaked during the 1970s and again in the early 1980s with films such asGet Carter(1971) andThe Long Good Friday(1980)) has undergone a series of re-inventions and re-appraisals. Two films are largely responsible for the cultural renaissance of the genre:Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels(Ritchie, 1998) which turned 25 in 2023 andSexy Beast, which turns 25 in 2025. These films established two parallel trends along which the genre would travel over the next quarter of a century.Lock Stock…very much product of the so called ‘lad culture’ of the 1990s, with its nostalgia for the classics of British gangster cinema, paved the way for contemporary gangster and crime films by the likes of Nick Love (The Football Factory(2004);The Business(2005)) and theRise of the Footsoldierfranchise (2007 – ).Sexy Beast, combined the tenets of the genre with a new art house sensibility, opening the way for directors such as Gerard Johnson (Hyena, 2014)and Nicolas Winding Refn (Bronson, 2008). As opposed to British horror cinema, which over the last 10 to 15 years has been the subject of an upswing in academic scrutiny, popular appeal and critical reappraisal, the British gangster film has evaded such scholarly attention, remaining instead an outlier of British cinema and the subject of cult interest and critical disdain. Criticisms of problematic sexual and racial politics, misogyny, and gratuitous violence (The Footsoldier franchise mainly bearing the brunt of this criticism) sidelined new films to limited, often straight to DVD/streaming, release. Nevertheless, with theActing Hardseason at the BFI exploring the often-problematic representations of working-class masculinity in British cinema, the genre looks to be again about to enter a phase of renewed popularity. This collection, which aims to coincide with the anniversaries of bothLock Stock…andSexy Beast, considers the legacies of these films on the current British gangster film, along with a broader address of this British cinematic tradition. It aims to reposition the genre into a place of cultural importance and examine the ways it engages with contemporary politics of class, race, and gender.Abstracts considered to include (but not be limited to):– Lock, Stock… and the cultural politics of the 1990s– Sexy Beast as a transitional gangster film– Gangster films and the Arthouse tradition– Lad culture and maleness in the British Gangster film– Representations of Spain in the gangster film– The politics of nostalgia– Whiteness and the cinematic perception of the white working class– Gangster films, globalisation, and Brexit– Star power and performance: Ian McShane, Vinnie Jones, John Hurt, Danny Dyer, Craig Fairbrass, Ray Winstone, Ben Kingsley– New directions in the British Gangster film– the work of Gerard Johnson – Space and place– Distribution, production, and reception– Contemporary cult British gangster cinema– The politics of sex, class, race, gender, and ethnicity– Harold Pinter and the British Gangster film– British gangster films and the UK film establishment– Spectacle, Violence and crime-  genre hybridity- Regionality-  Representations of London's East EndAbstracts should be emailed to the editors Matthew Melia (m.melia@kingston.ac.uk) and Katerina Flint-Nicol (kat.flintnicol@falmouth.ac.uk) no later than Feb 15th 2024","cultural studies and historical approaches, film and television, gender studies and sexuality, journals and collections of essays, popular culture",2023-10-05,2023,collection,,Kingston University; nan,United Kingdom; nan,,,165286.0
2010-4153-linguistic-discourse,Linguistic discourse analysis: Introduction and structure,https://call-for-papers.sas.upenn.edu/cfp/2010/12/23/linguistic-discourse-analysis-introduction-and-structure,,"Dr Vishnu Kumar Sharma and Mahesh Kumar Sharma / YIT, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India",vk_english75@yahoo.in,"Linguistic discourse analysis: Introduction and structure1.1	Defining discourseDiscourse is the creation and organization of the segments of a language above as well as below the sentence. It is segments of language which may be bigger or smaller than a single sentence but the adduced meaning is always beyond the sentence. The term discourse applies to both spoken and written language, in fact to any sample of language used for any purpose. Any series of speech events or any combination of sentences in written form wherein successive sentences or utterances hang together is discourse. Discourse can not be confined to sentential boundaries. It is something that goes beyond the limits of sentence. In another words discourse is 'any coherent succession of sentences, spoken or written'  (Matthews, 2005:100). The links between sentences in connected discourse are as much important as the links between clauses in a sentence.Two paradigms in linguistics viz formalist paradigm and functionalist paradigm make different background assumptions about the goals of a linguistic theory, the methods for studying language, and the nature of data and empirical evidence. These differences in paradigm also influence definitions of discourse. A definition as derived from formalist assumptions is that discourse is 'language above the sentence or above the clause'  (Stubbs 1983:1). Another definition derived from the functionalist paradigm views discourse as 'language use.' This definition observes the relationship the discourse has with the context. A third definition of discourse attempts to bridge the formalist-functionalist dichotomy. The relationship between form (structure) and function is an important issue in discourse.1.2	Defining discourse analysisThe study of naturally occurring connected sentences, spoken or written, is one of the most promising and rapidly developing areas of modern linguistics. Traditional linguistics has concentrated on sentence-centred analysis. Now, linguists are much more concerned with the way language is 'used' than what its components are. One may ask how it is that language-users interpret what other language-users intend to convey. When is carried this investigation further and asked how it is that people, as language-users, make sense of what they read in texts, understand what speakers mean despite what they say, recognize connected as opposed to jumbled or incoherent discourse, and successfully take part in that complex activity called conversation, then one is undertaking what is known as discourse analysis. The first linguist to refer to discourse analysis was Zellig Harris. In 1952, he investigated the connectedness of sentences, naming his study 'discourse analysis.' Harris claimed explicitly that discourse is the next level in a hierarchy of morphemes, clauses and sentences. He viewed discourse analysis procedurally as a formal methodology, derived from structural methods of linguistic analysis: such a methodology could break a text down into relationships (such as equivalence, substitution) among its lower-level constituents. Structural was so central to Harris's view of discourse that he also argued that what opposes discourse to a random sequence of sentences is precisely the fact that it has structure: a pattern by which segments of the discourse occur (and recur) relative to each other.Michael Stubbs says, 'Any study which is not dealing with (a) single sentences, (b) contrived by the linguist, (c) out of context, may be called discourse analysis.'  (Stubbs 1983:131).  In other words, there is a shift of focus from sentences in isolation to utterances in context: to study language in use is to study it as discourse. This is a fact that 'knowledge of a language is more than knowledge of individual sentences.'  (Leech 2008:76) The true meaning of a sentence can't be assigned by its only linguistic construction but it largely depends on reference (meaning in relation to exterior world), sense (meaning in relation to linguistic system) and force (meaning in relation to situational context). Let's take an example: I love you. Clearly the assigned meaning is different in different situations if the speaker is one's lover or beloved as opposed to one's parent or child. As Chomsky states, 'To understand a sentence we must know more than the analysis of this sentence on each linguistic level. We must also know the reference and meaning of the morphemes or words of which it is composed; naturally, grammar cannot be expected to be of much help here.' (Chomsky 2002:103-04). Widdowson, also criticizes the well familiar definition of discourse analysis that discourse is the study of language patterns above the sentence and states;If discourse analysis is defined as the study of language patterns above the sentence, this would seem to imply that discourse is sentence writ large: quantitatively different but qualitatively the same phenomenon. It would follow, too, of course, that you cannot have discourse below the sentence.  (Widdowson, 2004: 3)In other words, the discourse information is crucial to a complete theory of language. Smith and Kurthen also argue that 'the existence of arbitrary and language-specific syntactic and referential options for conveying a proposition requires a level of linguistic competence beyond sentential syntax and semantics'  (Smith and Kurthen 2007:455). Sentential models of linguistic competence are unequipped to explain the existence of and the difference between multiple sentence forms with the same semantic interpretation. Similarly, Prince argues, 'sentential grammars alone are not capable of constraining the use of definite and indefinite NPs'  (Prince 2004:119).There are several additional reasons for assuming that linguistic competence must be modeled beyond the level of the sentence. First, sentential grammars rely on the artifactual boundaries of written language. In some respects, this is a (short-term) advantage. The boundaries may be too small but they nonetheless provide a well-defined range of linguistic phenomena for a model of language to explain. In fact, this approach has been taken by generative grammarians for years with a great deal of success. However, the long-term disadvantages are also obvious. When one starts with a particular definition of language, any phenomena that do not fit into that definition will generally be ignored. If that definition is too narrow, then crucial data may be lost.Also, choosing to define language in terms of sentences in particular automatically includes a bias towards the type of language that one has been trained to consider 'proper' as opposed to what one knows through the initial process of first language acquisition. This argument alone takes our views beyond sentential boundaries. Once we accept that a language is not confined to sentence boundaries, we are free to explore broader possibilities.Second, the phenomenon of language requires at least a limited extension of sentential grammars. For example, sentential grammars can not completely account for the determination of pronoun co-reference, the scope of quantifiers, or the use of discourse deixis. In addition, 'English null arguments provide more evidence that knowledge of a language consists of more than a grammar for producing and interpreting sentences'  (Tracy 1995:215). It is obvious that null subjects play an active role in conversational English, though they have received little attention in the past due to their rarity in written or 'formal' English. It is also clear that the presence of implicit null objects in English may not be distinguishable from truly intransitive constructions without an examination of extra-sentential information.While defining discourse, three definitions have been discussed – one derived from formalist paradigm, other from functionalist paradigm and third that includes both formalist and functionalist paradigms. Discourse analysis also deals with these paradigms. Formalist or structural analysis of discourse describes '… discourse at several levels or dimensions of analysis and in terms of many different units, categories, schematic patterns or relations'  (Dijk 1985:4). Structural analyses focus on the way different units function in relation to each other but they disregard 'the functional relations with the context of which discourse is a part'  [Dijk 1985:4]. Structurally based analysis of discourse find 'constituents' (smaller linguistic units that have particular 'relationship' with one another and that can occur in a restricted number of (often ruled-governed) 'arrangements'. Structural views of discourse analysis accept that discourse is comprised of 'units.' Harris's unit was the morpheme (and their combination into sentences) while Linde, Labov and many other linguists identified clause as unit. Many contemporary structural analysis of discourse view the sentence as the unit of which discourse is comprised.The structural view of discourse analysis places discourse in a hierarchy of language structures, thus fostering the view that one can describe language in a unitary way that continues unimpeded from morpheme to clause to sentence to discourse. But this kind of analysis does not pay attention to the purposes and functions for which so called 'units' are designed to serve in human affairs.Discourse analysis is necessarily the analysis of language in use. The functionalist view of discourse analysis asserts that 'the study of discourse is the study of any aspect of language use'  (Fasold 1990:65). Discourse analysis can not be restricted to the description of linguistic forms independent of the purposes and functions which these forms perform. Functional analyses of discourse rely less upon the strictly grammatical characteristics of utterances as sentences, than upon the way utterances are situated in contexts.1.3	Historical view of discourse analysisDiscourse analysis deals language in use: written text of all kinds and spoken data. It received attention in different disciplines in the 1960s and early 1970s, including linguistics, semiotics, anthropology, psychology and sociology. At a time when linguistics was largely concerned with the analysis of single sentences, Zelling Harris published a paper with the title 'Discourse analysis' in 1952. Harris was interested in the distribution of linguistic elements in extended texts, and the links between the text and its social situation. Also important in the early years was the emergence of semiotics and the French structuralist approach to the study of narrative. In the 1960s, Dell Hymes provided a sociological perspective with the study of speech in its social setting. The linguistic philosophers such as Austin (1962), Searle (1969) and Grice (1975) were also influential in the study of language as social action, reflected in speech-act theory and the formulation of conversational maxims, alongside the emergence of pragmatics which is the study of meaning in context.British discourse analysis was greatly influenced by M. A. K. Halliday's functional approach to language, which in turn has connexions with the Prague School of linguists. Halliday's framework emphasizes the social functions of language and the thematic and informational structure of speech and writing. Also important in Britain were Sinclair and Coulthard (1975) at the University of Birmingham, who developed a model for the description of teacher pupil talk, based on a hierarchy of discourse units. Other similar work has dealt with doctor-patient interaction, service encounters, interviews, debates and business negotiations, as well as monologues. Novel work in the British tradition has also been done on intonation in discourse. The British work has principally followed structural-linguistic criteria, on the basis of the isolation of units, and sets of rules defining well-formed sequences of discourse.American discourse analysis has been dominated by work within the ethnomethodological tradition, which emphasizes the research method of close observation of groups of people communicating in natural settings. It examines types of speech event such as storytelling, greeting rituals and verbal duels in different cultural and social settings. What is often called conversation analysis within the American tradition can also be included under the general heading of discourse analysis. In conversational analysis, the emphasis is not upon building structural models but on the close observation of the behaviour of participants in talk and on patterns which recur over a wide range of natural data. The work of Goffman (1976; 1979), and Sacks Schegloff and Jefferson (1974) is important in the study of conversational norms, turn-taking, and other aspects of spoken interaction. Alongside the conversation analysts, working within the sociolinguistic tradition, Labov's investigations of oral storytelling have also contributed to a long history of interest in narrative discourse. The American work has produced a large number of descriptions of discourse types as well as insights into the social constraints of politeness and face-preserving phenomena in talk, overlapping with British work in pragmatics.Also relevant to the development of discourse analysis as a whole is the work of text grammarians, working mostly with written language. Text grammarians see texts as language elements strung together in relationships with one another that can be defined. Linguists such as Van Dijk (1972), De Beaugrande (1980), Halliday and Hasan (1976) have made a significant impact in this area. The Prague School of linguists, with their interest in the structuring of information in discourse, has also been influential. Its most important contribution has been to show the links between grammar and discourse.1.4	The scope of discourse analysisDiscourse analysis has grown into a wide-ranging and heterogeneous discipline which finds its unity in the description of language above as well as below the sentence and an interest in the contexts and cultural influences which affect language in use. For example A asks; 'why are you weeping?' B replies; 'shocked.' The reply of B is not a sentence according to the standard sentence pattern but the meaning is clear and it is context that leaves no doubt in the mind of A about the cause and effect of B's being shocked thus discourse is the creation and organization of language above as well as below the sentence. It is segments of language which may be bigger or smaller than a single sentence but the adduced meaning is always beyond the sentence. It is not only concerned with the description and analysis of spoken interaction but it deals with written discourse. People daily encounter hundreds of written and printed words: newspapers, recipes, stories, letters, comics, notices, instructions, leaflets pushed through the door, and so on. They usually expect them to be coherent, meaningful communications in which the words and/or sentences are linked to one another in a fashion that corresponds to conventional formulae, just they we do with speech.Discourse analysis has received ever-increasing attention from different disciplines. It includes taxonomy, speech act theory, interactional sociolinguistics, ethnographies of communication, pragmatics, conversation analysis, and variationist discourse analysis (one could also add critical discourse analysis, narrative analysis, discursive psychology, and more) and ranges from philosophy to linguistics to semiotics to sociology to anthropology, and so on. Such a wide range of its fields indicates that the notion of discourse is itself quite broad. This may also suggest why discourse analysis has emerged as a special interest in the past few decades—the fact that diverse fields find the study of discourse useful indicates larger cultural and epistemological shifts.1.5	Sentence and utteranceAlthough there might appear little difference in the kind of information which is presented in these alternative formulations, there is considerable difference in the purpose for which these formulations are made. A sentence is an exemplificatory device and that its function is simply to give concrete realization to the abstract features of the system of language. Sentences are an exemplification of linguistic rules while utterances are a direct realization of linguistic rules.It is an important point to make clear the relationship between them: utterances being 'derived' from sentences, or sentences 'underlying' utterances. Sentences are simply construct devised by linguists to exemplify the rules of the language system and that a speaker therefore may have no knowledge of the sentences as such at all. An illiterate speaker has an innate knowledge of the rules of the language system acquired through his natural linguistic development and he composes his utterances by direct reference to them and not by reference to sentences. One might say that sentences exemplify the rules which the speaker realizes in the making of utterances. The knowledge one has of one's language can be expressed in the form of sentences since a grammar is defined as a description of the sentences of language. What the speaker of a language knows is sentences. This comes out clearly when Chomsky speaks of language acquisition; 'Clearly, a child who has learned a language has developed an internal representation of a system of rules that determine how sentences are formed, used, and understood.'  (Chomsky 1965:25)1.6	Cohesion and coherenceA piece of discourse must have a certain structure which depends on factors quite different from those required in the structure of a single sentence. The way sentences link up with each other to form discourse is cohesion. Cohesion makes the items hang together. Cohesion comes about as a result of the combination of both lexical and grammatical structures.  It should be considered in terms of the two basic dimensions of linguistic organization – paradigmatic and syntagmatic. In this way it is meaningful to extend the principles of linguistic description beyond the limit of the sentence. One can study the structure of discourse paradigmatically by tracing the manner in which the constituent linguistic elements are related along the axis of equivalence, or one can study it syntagmatically by tracing the manner in which the linguistic elements are related along the axis of combination. By taking the former, one recognizes pronouns and other pro-forms as cohesive devises, and by taking the latter, it is such forms as sentence connectors and the thematic arrangements of sentence constituents which emerge the principal features of cohesion.Cohesion through combination and cohesion through equivalence are discussed by Halliday as cohesion through grammar and cohesion through lexis. In grammatical scheme, he talks about subordination, co-ordination, pronouns etc. and in lexical scheme, he deals with repetition or occurrence of item in the same lexical set.Analysis of cohesive links within a discourse gives one some insight into how writers structure what they want to say. Many devices are used to create cohesion such as recurrence, use of pro-forms, connectors, thematic arrangements etc.Connections between other words and sentences, which is the field of cohesion, would not be sufficient to enable one to make sense of what we read and hear. It is quite easy to create a highly cohesive piece of discourse which has a lot of connections between the sentences, but which remain difficult to interpret. It is people who make sense of what they read and hear. They try to arrive at on interpretation which is in line with their experience of the way the world is. So, the 'connectedness' which people experience in their interpretation of what is being heard or read is coherence.Cohesion is connectivity of the surface, whereas coherence deals with connectivity of underlying content. Coherence, in other words, is related to the mutual accessibility and relevance of concepts and relations that underlie the surface level. A reader or listener would have to create meaningful connections which are not always expressed by the words and sentences, taking into account the surface phenomena.People often take part in conversational interactions where a great deal of what is meant is not actually present in what is said and they ordinarily anticipate each other's intentions, which makes this whole complex process easy going. The following example given by Widdowson can be taken into account:Her:	That's the telephone.Him:	I'm in the both.Her:	O.K.Here one finds no cohesive ties within this fragment of discourse. It is due to coherence that each of these people manages to make sense of what the other says. This brief conversation can be understood in the following way:She requested him to perform action.He gives reason why he is unable to comply with request.She undertakes to perform action.It is possible to produce language which is cohesive without being coherent as discourse and vice-versa. This is not to say that there is no correspondence between them: very often, and particularly in written discourse, there might be a very close correspondence between cohesion and coherence. But they remain two different aspects of linguistic organization: cohesion is the link between sentences, and coherence the link between the communicative acts which the sentence perform.1.7	Theme and rheme'Theme', if one takes it as a formally constrained category, has to do with the left-most constituent in the sentence or clause and 'rheme' with everything that follows theme. Each simple sentence has a theme 'the starting point of the utterance' and a rheme, everything else that follows in the sentence which consists of 'what the speaker states about, or in regard to, the starting point of the utterance'  (Mathesius 1992: 28). The theme, then, is what speakers or writers use as a 'point of departure'  (Webster, 2005:195) Concentrating on the themes (or topics) of sentences does not tell someone much about the rest of the sentence, which is called the rheme (or comment) of the sentence. In fact, when someone looks at the themes and rhemes together in connected discourse, they see further patterns emerging. To make the theme marked, a speaker or writer uses fronting device. For example:John calls it relaxation.	(Unmarked theme)Relaxation, John calls it.	(Marked theme)'The more marked the construction, the more likely an implicated meaning will be that which the utterance is intended to convey'  (Davidson 1980:46). One may talk in general of thematisation as a discoursal rather than simply a sentential process. What the speaker or writer puts first will influence the interpretation of everything that follows. The first sentence of the first paragraph will constrain the interpretation not only of the paragraph, but also of the rest of the discourse. The notion of 'relative prominence' arising from process of thematisation plays a vital role in discourse structure because the way a piece of discourse is staged, must have significant effect both on the process of interpretation and on the process of subsequent recall.1.8	Discourse and modeWhen one views manifestations of discourse, one immediately finds that the term discourse applies to both spoken and written language. The mode of discourse is related to the distinction between speech and writing. Mode 'has to do with the effects of the medium in which the language is transmitted'  (Leech, Deuchar and Hoogenraad 1993:9). It is distinction between the auditory and visual medium.Although written discourse is no worse than spoken discourse, yet the latter is always considered much more important and much emphasis is laid on it. 'Some linguists go so far as to say that speech is language, and that writing is simply a reflection of speech in a different medium'  (Allen and Pit Corder 1980:26). Others can give less importance to speech, but most linguists accept the fact that speech is the primary medium as it is older and more widespread than writing, and a child always learns to speak before s/he learns to write.Spoken discourse is a vast phenomenon, and all can not be anticipated in hard statistical terms of the distribution of different types of speech in people's everyday lives. If one lists at random a number of different types of speech and consider how much of each day or week people spend engaged in each one, one can only roughly guess at some sort of frequency ranking, other than to say that casual conversation is almost certainly the most frequent for most people.1.8.1	Some types of spoken discourseIt is not an easy job to predict all types of spoken discourse because a person encounters different types of speech even within a single day. Conversations vary in their settings and degree of structuredness. Some types of speech are as follows:Telephone calls			(Business and private)Classroom				(Classes, lectures, tutorials, seminars)Interviews				(Jobs, journalistic, in official settings)Service encounters			(Hotels, ticket offices, shops, etc.)Rituals					(Prayers, sermons, weddings)Language-in-action	(Talk accompanying doing: fixing, cooking, demonstrating, assembling, etc.)Monologues				(Strangers, relatives, friends)Organizing and directing people	(Work, home, in the street)One should look closely at the forms and patterns of different types of spoken discourse. Different roles and settings generate different forms and structures, and discourse analysts try to observe in natural data just what patterns occur in particular settings.1.8.2	Some types of written discourseEveryday people come into contact with written texts and interpret their meanings so as to get what they intend. We can never think of a literate man who never writes or tries to write something. Like spoken discourse, written discourse is also of many kinds as:NewspaperPoemLetter to/from friendBusiness letterInstruction leafletLiterary publicationPublic noticeAcademic articleSmall adsIt is certain that most people will read more of the text types mentioned above than actually write them. Both spoken and written discourse perform different functions in society, use different forms, and exhibit different linguistic characteristics.1.8.3	Functions of written spoken discourseSpoken and written discourse make somewhat different demands related to functions that they perform. Writing has the advantage of relative permanence, which allows for record-keeping (storage function) in a form independent of the memories of those who keep the records. Written discourse can communicate over a great distance (by letters, newspapers, etc.), and to large numbers simultaneously (by publications of all kinds). The invention of the tape-recorder, the telephone, the radio and television have helped to overcome the limitations of the spoken language regarding time, distance and numbers.Written discourse is not only permanent but also visible. An important consequence of this is that the writer may look over what he has already written, pause between each word with no fear of his interlocutor interrupting him. He may take his time in choosing a particular word, even looking it up in the dictionary if necessary. Written language makes possible the creation of literary works of art in ways comparable with the creation of paintings or sculpture.Speech, of course, retains functions which writing will never be able to fulfil, such as quick, direct communication with immediate feedback from the addressee. The speaker must monitor what it is that he has just said, and determine whether it matches his intentions, while he is uttering his current phrase and monitoring that, and simultaneously planning his next utterance and fitting that into the overall pattern of what he wants to say and monitoring, moreover, not only his own performance but its reception by his hearer.The view that written discourse and spoken discourse serve, in general, quite different functions in society has been forcefully propounded by scholars whose main interest lies in anthropology and sociology. Goody suggests that analytic thinking followed the acquisition of written language 'since it was the setting down of speech that enabled man clearly to separate words, to manipulate their order and to develop syllogistic forms of reasoning'  (Goody 1977:11). But we can not deny the fact that speech is an everyday activity for almost everyone, whereas written discourse may not be. Nor can we state that spoken and written discourse are not complementary in function and one is more important than the other.1.8.4	The form of spoken and written discourseAs well as being different in function, spoken and written discourse differ in forms as a result of the difference of medium. Features of spoken discourse such as rhythm, intonation and non-linguistic noises such as sighs and laughter are absent in written discourse. Spoken discourse can also be accompanied by non-verbal communication such as gestures and facial expressions because speech is typically used in a face-to-face situation. These features can not easily be conveyed by written discourse. Written discourse also has several features which spoken discourse lacks. We can include punctuation, paragraphing and the capitalization of letters. In written discourse, intonation can to some extent be conveyed by punctuation, but not completely. The intonation of the sentence 'I'll buy a shirt for you from High Street' will differ according to whether the action or object or person or place is the most important idea. The different meanings, thus, implied by differences of intonation would be difficult to convey in written discourse without changing the structure of the sentence.1.8.5	Linguistic characteristics of spoken and written discourseThere are different linguistic characteristics of both of these discourses. Just as the differences of the function and forms of spoken and written discourse overlap one another in the same way the characteristics of these two discourses, as will be discussed, have actually some overlap between the two.1.8.5.1 Normal non-fluencySpoken discourse is generally characterized by normal non-fluency. Normal non-fluency refers to unintended repetitions (e.g. I. I …), fillers (e.g. um, er), false starts, grammatical blends and unfinished sentences. One finds false start 'where a sentence is broken off midway as a result of a change of mind'  (Leech, Deuchar and Hoogenraad 1993:139); for example, 'You should – well tackle it yourself.' When one begins in one way and ends in another, one tends to blend; for example in 'Do you know where is my office?' here the sentence begins as an indirect question but ends as a direct question. In spoken discourse, people face the phenomena of hesitation that lead to non-fluency. Spoken discourse contains many incomplete sentences, often simply sequences of phrases. Written discourse, on the other hand, does not, naturally, face such phenomena and as a result it appears more fluent.1.8.5.2 Monitoring and interaction featuresThese features are found in spoken discourse because of its use in dialogue, with a physically present addressee. Monitoring features 'indicate the speaker's awareness of the addressee's presence and reactions'  (Leech, Deuchar and Hoogenraad 1993:139). In monitoring, one uses such adverbs and adverbials as 'well', 'I think', 'I mean', 'you know', 'you see', 'sort of'. Interaction features call the active participation of the addressee. Interaction features include second person pronoun, questions, imperatives etc. Written discourse if it is not in dialogue form, generally, lacks these features.1.8.5.3 InexplicitnessIn speech, people have both the auditory and visual media available, as speech is generally used in face-to-face situations. In spoken discourse, one encounters inexplicitness because of many facts such as shared knowledge of the participants, which makes explicitness unnecessary; extra information is conveyed by 'body language' (e.g. gestures, facial expressions); the immediate and intended physical environment can be referred to (e.g. by pointing to people or objects); and one has advantage of feedback from the hearer so as to make intended message clear. Pronouns such as this, that, it, are used frequently in speech, which leads to inexplicitness. In written discourse, a writer does not have the advantage of the addressee's presence, so he must be much more explicit in his process. Avoiding the above mentioned inexplicitness, written discourse also acquires explicitness with the help of clear sentence boundaries but in speech sentences may be unfinished, because the knowledge of the addressee makes completion unnecessary.1.8.5.4 Simplicity of structureSimplicity and complexity of structures are marked by the subordination of clauses and noun and adjectival phrases. How many elements the clauses or phrases contain or how many levels of subordination there are tend to mark simplicity or complexity. In written discourse, rather heavily pre-modified noun phrases are quite common – it is rare in spoken discourse. Nesting and embedding of clauses is much more found in written discourse. Spoken discourse is less complex than written because of the short time available to produce and process it. Written discourse, on the other hand, can be re-drafted and re-read.1.8.5.5 RepetitivenessSince spoken discourse is less permanent, it requires more repetition than written discourse. In spoken discourse, the addressee can not easily refer back to what has gone before, so important information has to be repeated. This can be noticed, for example, in normal conversation.The category of mode with reference to spoken and written discourse, as has been discussed, has peculiar linguistic characteristics, but there can be some overlap in these characteristics, depending on what they are used for, and in what situation.1.9	Discourse and tenorDiscourse varies, as has been viewed, according to whether it is spoken or written, now discussions will be about how it varies according to factors such as who it is for, in what situation, and what kind of activity the language is being used for. Tenor 'has to do with the relationship between a speaker and the addressee(s) in a given situation, and is often characterized by greater or lesser formality'  (Leech, Deuchar and Hoogenraad 1993:9). Tenor can be formal or informal, polite or familiar and impersonal or personal. If the relationship between the speaker and addressee is official and distant, for example in a legal document, the tenor will be formal, and if it is close and intimate, for example a conversation between friends, the tenor will be informal. A formal discourse will have complex sentences and polysyllabic vocabulary while in an informal discourse there will be simple sentences and monosyllabic vocabulary.The tenor of discourse will be polite if the speaker and addressee are not well known to one another, whereas it will be familiar if the speaker and the addressee are well known and intimate to one another. Politeness is of more relevance when the addressee are physically present, or when the function of the discourse is to have an effect on the addressee, as in advertising. To create politeness, one uses respectful terms of address, e.g. sir, indirect requests, e.g. would you mind…, would you be so kind as to…, etc. We use intimate terms of addressee, e.g. my love, Mary, direct imperatives, e.g. close the door, Give me…, etc. to make discourse familiar.There will be impersonality if the roles of the speaker and addressee are in the background, as in written documents with no specific author or addressee, or in news broadcasts wherein neither the role of the speaker nor that of addressee is prominent. Passivisation, third person noun phrases, e.g. passengers, the reader etc. create impersonality, whereas first and second person pronouns, e.g. I, you etc. deal with personal tenor.1.10	Discourse and domainDomain 'has to do with how language varies according to the activity in which it plays a part'  (Leech, Deuchar and Hoogenraad 1993:9). Discourse varies according to the field in which it functions. The discourse of journalism is not the same as that of religion or law. Functions of language are different according to different field or activity, which leads to construct different discourse.One may be a lawyer advising a client, a bus conductor collecting fares, on engineer giving instructions to a draughtsman, a trade-union official discussing fringe benefits, a sergeant instructing a soldier or a scientist reading a technical report. One may be playing different games. Or relating to his/her home life, one may be acting as father, mother, son, daughter, husband or wife. When one notices these activities, one will find discourses that are typical of the activity involved.Discourse can 'convey information, express feelings and persuade someone to do something'  (Thornton 2008:17), wherein we have referential, expressive and conative functions of discourse respectively. Discourse has many domains such as advertising, journalism, law, religion, literature, politics, conversation etc., each having different characteristics which determine peculiarities of discourse. If advertisements, for example, are to achieve their purpose, which is to sell a product, they have to be easy to read. The sentence structure must be simple with less subordination. Advertising language is typically very informal and personal and in the form of direct address. Advertising discourse shows some of the characteristics which we associate with spoken discourse, even when it occurs in written form (e.g. in press advertisements).1.11CONCLUSIONThe present article has dealt with some of the ingredients which are required to construct an account of how people use language to communicate with each other. It is people who communicate and people who interpret. It is speakers or writers who have presuppositions and who make reference. One thinks of none but hearers or readers who interpret and draw inferences. This view is opposed to the study of these issues in terms of sentences considered in isolation from communicative contexts. In appealing to this approach, the present study has taken a compromise position which suggests that discourse analysis on the one hand includes the study of linguistic forms and the regularities of their distribution and, on the other hand, involves a consideration of the general notions of interpretation by which people normally make sense of what they hear and read.Discourse analysis is a multi-disciplinary approach. It includes many disciplines such as sociology, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, anthropology etc. These different disciplines tend to concentrate on different aspects of discourse. How discourse analysis is concerned with the structure of social interaction manifested in conversation has been discussed in this study. Discourse plays different roles in different social contexts. It may have different meaning and relevance when it occurs in different situations. There can also be predictions of who will open, who will interrupt and who will close the discourse because of the shared and established conventions of situations. But where talk is more casual, and among equals, everyone will have a part to play is controlling and monitoring the discourse, and the phenomenon of discourse will look considerably more complicated.Discourse analysis does not put emphasis on sentences in isolation but tends to concentrate on linked utterances. It is cohesive combination of utterances which makes meaning and appeals to a reader or hearer. To create isolated sentences is of no importance but the creation of links across utterances is much more important in discourse. Reading of written discourse or hearing of spoken discourse is both more important and complex than the knowledge of linguistic forms because a reader or listener has to interpret ties and make sense of them. Making sense of a piece of discourse is an act of interpretation that depends as much on what people as readers/listeners bring to that piece of discourse as what the author/speaker puts into it. How people make sense of and comprehend discourse has also been taken into account in this study. One has to be concerned with semantic relationships between constructed pairs of sentences and with their syntactic realization in order to deal successfully with discourse analysis.The present article has also attempted to show how discourse analysis has contributed to the understanding of the relationship between choices within the sentence and the organization and interpretation of the discourse as a whole. Discourse analysis helps not only a speaker/writer to select right choices of words, syntax and utterances according to particular situations but it supports also a hearer/reader to interpret and infer the right meaning of discourse. It provides access to what a speaker/author intends, or how sincerely he is behaving in the production of a discourse fragment.Discourse constitutes ubiquitous ways of knowing, valuing and experiencing the world. It is used in everyday local texts and talks for building productive power and knowledge and for purposes of regulation and normalization, for the development of new knowledge and power relations. Only to know what discourse is is not sufficient but one must also know how it is produced and understood. This consideration has been dealt in the present dissertation.Discourse analysis has presented a fundamentally different way of looking at language compared with sentence-dominated models, one in which the traditional elements of grammar, lexis and phonology still have a fundamental part to play, but one which is bigger and more immediately relevant. There will, no doubt, be many other things that will need to be said about discourse analysis, for discourse analysis is a fast moving discipline, and people's knowledge of how language occurs in its natural contexts is growing all the time. What is more, one now knows more about what people actually do with language when they speak and write, and no longer has to rely on classical – based notions of what 'good' usage is. People know more about the delicate relationship between language forms and particular contexts and users; such knowledge can only be immensely valuable.The application of discourse analysis to educational research will require nothing less than the development of a new sociology of educational discourse. Discourse analysis enables one to model how language and discourse figure in the production and reproduction of educational outcomes. It enables the teachers to make up their own minds as to whether their methods and techniques need rethinking in the light of what discourse analysts say. It marks out the grounds for rethinking pedagogical practices and outcomes as discourse.The assumption underlying many modern curriculum development and instructional models is that the purpose of education is to produce behaviours, skills and competences required for industrial-era work places and civic spheres. Shifting population, new social geographies, new communities having the phenomenon of multiculturalism and new information technologies are altering social relations and how discourse is learned and used. The conditions have changed and are also changing, which provides the people with hybrid written and spoken discourse.To cope with the prevailing conditions which have the tendency of intercultural and interlingual communications, the people are in the dying need of the support of discourse analysis. Mastery of discourse is the principle educational process and outcome, and this mastery can be reshaped by introducing learners to a new phenomenon of discourse. Above all, the analysis of discourse, undertaken in the manner presented in this dissertation, will not only provide the reader with insights into the workings of his own language, but also encourage him to think afresh about the nature of that complex cognitive and social phenomenon we call 'discourse'.End notes:Matthews, P.H.

From the rise of totalitarianism to the dwindling borders of the British Empire, global citizens were under constant scrutiny as governments, artists, and documentarians developed new ways of listening in. The establishment of intelligence agencies such as the FBI and MI5 just prior to WWI; the standardization of the passport and increased policing of borders; the formation of Mass Observation, with its trained observers who ""may be watching you""; the mass production of the 35mm camera and other technologies of information gathering: all reveal a widespread concern with observation. People looked both forward and back, documenting traditions and making plans for the future.This conference asks not only how tropes of surveillance and documentation shaped culture in the years spanning the First and Second World Wars, but also how artists, writers, filmmakers, and activists resisted surveillance, whether by going underground or by watching the watchers. From the nightmare world of Franz Kafka's The Trial to the panoptic dystopia of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, from the spy film's impetus to track the ""foreigner"" to the ever increasing need for documentation, the culture and politics of observation proliferate across this tumultuous period.We welcome proposals that engage with the concept and representation of surveillance in wartime and the interwar period.

2019-1876-queer-fire,"""Queer Fire: Liberation and Abolition"" (a special issue of GLQ)",https://call-for-papers.sas.upenn.edu/cfp/2019/08/27/queer-fire-liberation-and-abolition-a-special-issue-of-glq,"March 15, 2020",GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies (Duke University Press),queerfireabolition@gmail.com,"Call for Submissions“Queer Fire: Liberation and Abolition”Modes of imprisonment not only pervade historical and contemporary life but, more substantively, structure the grounds of sociality. Calls for justice, then, must have at their fundament abolition, and abolition must be understood as the complete obliteration of modes of imprisonment so as to create a world which would sustain life through forms of justice not conceived through violence. This would entail a radical reorientation to life and living. This reorientation must attend to gender, as gender is one of the chief forms of imprisonment—in the double sense that gender, it can be asserted, is a kind of prison; and the institutions of prisons have at their centers the regulatory (re)production of the gender binary.In “Building an Abolitionist Trans and Queer Movement with Everything We’ve Got,” the very first chapter in the collectionCaptive Genders: Trans Embodiment and the Prison Industrial Complex, Morgan Bassichis, Alexander Lee, and Dean Spade provocatively suggest, “Impossibility may very well be our only possibility.” They go on to ask, “What would it mean toembrace, rather thanshy away from, the impossibility of our ways of living as well as our political visions? What would it mean to desire a future that we can’t even imagine but that we are told couldn’t ever exist?” (42). This special issue ofGLQ, titled “Queer Fire: Liberation and Abolition,” seeks to begin with these questions of im/possibility, futurity and presence, and knowledge and practice to explore the ways in which queerness converges with abolition.Contemporary queer studies scholars often undersell the impact and importance of abolition in their theorizations, and abolitionist thinkers and activists often do not consider queerness and nonnormative genders as sites of critical interrogation. In other words, queer studies often addresses abolitionin namebut does not attend to its blast radius and impact on how queerness and gender are encountered; and relatedly, abolitionist thinkers often simply name rather than interrogate and, indeed, work to abolish gender. This issue, then, is an occasion to build on work done by those who move simultaneously in both political spaces – prison abolitionism and queer liberation – to more critically examine the possibilities and challenges that emerge when these radical traditions are more explicitly and sustainedly brought together. Extending the work of abolitionist feminists like Angela Davis, Beth Richie, Mariame Kaba, Ruth Wilson Gilmore, and Victoria Law, and queer abolitionists like Eric A. Stanley, Che Gossett, and Dean Spade, we wish to bring together scholars and activists working at the intersections of queer theory, critical race studies, and radical activist movements to consider how queer liberation and prison abolition are conceptually, theoretically, and practically entwined. This entwinement may help us think with Bassichis, Lee, and Spade’s invocation of impossibility as a framework for both theory and practice. Ultimately, one way to frame this special issue is,How do abolition and queer liberation both name and enact the impossible?Understanding queerness capaciously in a way that brings together various modes of nonnormative subjectivity—what Cathy Cohen has described in her 1997GLQessay “Punks, Bulldaggers, and Welfare Queens” as an identity “rooted not in our shared history or identity but in our shared marginal relationship to dominant power”—this special issue queries: What is queer about abolition? Is abolition endemic to queerness? What would an abolitionary project centering queerness look like? What is abolition’s and queerness’s relationship with transgender subjectivities? And how do the future-visions of abolition and queer liberation come together in the here and now?This special issue addresses these questions from an understanding of abolition and queerness as more radical than an emancipatory project. Implicit in emancipation is a liberal gender justice: yearning for equality, for anyone’s gender to be on an equal and level playing field as others (think of “gender-responsive prisons”). Rather, we invite writers to consider gender abolition in such a way that presumes that gender itself may be the proposition of corporeal and social order that benefits power. As such, we want to ask what might happen if queer abolition seeks the obliteration of gender since abolition is eradication “of the terms of order” (Sexton, “Abolition Terminal,” 317).In addition to inviting contributors to continue considering the ways in which the entwinement of abolition and queerness exceeds additive logic, we invite contributors to continue to build this important field of thought in various ways. How, for example, does attending to carceral regimes beyond the United States sharpen our analyses of both the prison-industrial complex and political projects which seek to make life more livable for queer subjects? Expanding the geographic scope beyond the U.S. also invites further thinking with the coloniality of the gender binary and the possibilities which may emerge in considering decolonial epistemologies of gender. If it is the case that genders beyond the Western male/female binary preexist colonial conquest and the binary itself, these understandings and experiences of nonnormative gender also precede the relatively recent rise of the prison-industrial complex and the carceral state, so how might decolonial and indigenous thought further enrich the field of queer abolitionism?The issue is open to traditional critical, article-length pieces, shorter reflections, and individual or collaborative work in music, performance, and art. To this end, we are interested in hearing from a broad spectrum of scholars, artists, thinkers, activists, and organizers that span disciplines such as cultural studies, ethnic studies, American studies, English and modern languages, history, geography, anthropology, and sociology. The following topics are particularly of interest, though this is not an exhaustive list:Antebellum plantation systems, abolition, and queernessIncarceration and abolition in the global SouthThe generational divide in understandings of abolition and queernessPrisons as they intersect with disability(Queer) masculinitiesQueer anthropologies and incarcerationLiterary depictions of queer abolitionTransformative justice and restorative justice systems as queer projectsIndigenous epistemologies of gender and justiceTrans experience and incarcerationQueer analyses of policing and surveillanceMeditations on gender abolition with respect to gender transitioning/grafting/affirmationHistories of queer abolitionist organizingAIDS organizing inside prisonsAbolitionist campaigns focused on queer and/or trans peoplePathologizations and medicalizations of criminality and queernessThe potentials and limits of rights-based activismThe criminalization of race and queernessThe issue will be coedited by Marquis Bey (Northwestern University) and Jesse A.

Lewis,tyson.lewis@unt.edu,"Antifascist EducationSpecial Issue for the journalReview of Education, Pedagogy, and Cultural StudiesEditors:Dr. Tyson E. Lewis, PhD, University of North TexasSilas Krabbe, PhD in progress, University of British ColumbiaThe specter of fascism has returned with a vengeance in the form of multiple, interconnected, highly militant, overtly violent, extremist movements not only on the peripheries of the Western world but also in its centers. Upheavals caused by a series of global crises and the weakening influence of democratic institutions have created conditions conducive to the fomentation of fascist sentiments and startling connections between mainstream political parties and neo-Nazi, white supremacist, and populist fringe groups. These groups often claim their Aryan heritage is under attack by a cabal of powerful Jewish families they call ZOG, or Zionist Occupied Government, that secretly controls the culture industry, financial networks, and nation-state governments with the hidden agenda to eradicate the white race. They draw upon a host of symbols from Nazi propaganda, pagan rituals, and Judeo-Christian imagery while valorizing fascist leaders such as Hitler. And they actively pursue acts of homegrown terror. In the United States alone, these groups have engaged in murder, the planned kidnapping of government officials, and attempted sabotage of urban infrastructure all to “accelerate” an impending race war. Indeed, in 2020, the Department of Homeland Security in the United States ranked domestic violent extremist movements fueled by racism and nativism as the single most dangerous terrorist threat facing the country. In fact, more or less mainstream political figures such as Madeleine Albright have issued warnings against the rising tide of fascism, and Mark Milley, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated “This is a Reichstag moment,” fearing a coup by extremist groups to overturn the 2019 election results. Bearing this in mind, we cannot reduce the return of the discourse of fascism to leftist alarmism.Beyond some historical treatments and a few publications that address antifascist education directly, antifascist education has yet to garner significant and sustained attention from educational theorists and philosophers. Whereas DEI, antiracist, LGBTQI, and even anticapitalist theory have acquired traction within fields of education, antifascist education seems to flounder. This volume will attempt to: 1) understand the current state of antifascism in education, 2) consider the distinctiveness of antifascism in education 3) offer trajectories for antifascist theorization and practice in education.The aim of this volume is to provide educators with a more robust understanding, treatment, and approach to antifascist education. Through broad and sustained consideration of what is often a nebulous and disputed concept, this volume will attempt to bring clarity to the theoretical terrain of antifascist education and pedagogy such that continued anti-fascist praxis of education will be empowered.Key questions the special issue will cover:Why has antifascist education and pedagogy not developed as a site of robust educational conversation, theorization, and praxis?What is it about the nebulous, difficult-to-define nature of fascism that makes the construction of an educational discourse of antifascism so challenging in comparison to other contested categories like race, democracy, and neoliberalism, which have successfully developed discourses within education?Where is fascism at play in education? Where ought antifascist energy be directed?What contemporary political trends and events provide insight into the current moment of burgeoning fascism globally? How do these contemporary events shape the antifascist educational response?What distinguishes antifascist education from democratic education more broadly? Which liberal assumptions require retention for antifascist education, which assumptions are non-essential?Is illiberalism merely fascism’s new name in politics? What would differ educationally in responses to illiberalism versus fascism?Do fascism and antifascism entail ontological and metaphysical assumptions or claims? If so, what are they, and how do they differ?Is antifascism a big-tent category within which DEI, antiracism, anti-imperialism, anticapitalism, LGBTQ+, indigenous, decolonialism, disability studies, and democratic education can work upon common ground and aims? If not, why not? What specifically does antifascist education offer that these discourses do not?What is fascism’s relation to modernity, late-modernity, and post-modernity? Does considering fascism in relation to these meta-categories change antifascist education? If so, how?Which political theories are antifascist, and which are not? What is the educational difference?Does fascism have an onto-epistemology? If so, what differs in an antifascist onto-epistemology?How might a discourse of antifascist educational theory and pedagogy be developed wherein contemporary uses of “fascist” as a political demonization and polarization tactic do not come to dominate the discursive arena?How does a vision of the good life, or a lack thereof, play into both the problem of fascism and the antifascist response?Where are the edges of ethics in relation to antifascist education?What might psychoanalysis, affect theory, psychology, and contemporary philosophy of mind offer antifascist education?How is affect connected to fascism and antifascism? Does affect theory aid in theorizing the distinction between fascism and antifascism?We are also looking for contributions that draw inspiration for antifascist education theory and practice from a wide variety of sources including but not limited to: members of the Frankfurt School, Georges Bataille, Hannah Arendt, Primo Levi, Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, and antifascist educators/activist in post-war Germany, the United States, and beyond.We invite established and emerging scholars, researchers, educators and members of community organizations to contribute to this discussion through their paper submissions on the suggested themes or related discourses.Please submit an abstract of up to 200 words, on your proposed paper for this special issue based on any of the above themes/topics by June 1, 2023. Drafts of accepted articles will subsequently be due by September 1, 2023.In addition, indicate your institutional or organizational affiliation.

Connell published her groundbreaking and inspiring work, Masculinities, and masculinity studies has become a major field of study, a conceptual domain ready to come out of the closet, and a central critical point of reference in gender, identity, power and trans-anything discussions. The debate over the public visibility and hierarchy of gendered identities has manifested itself as a complicated conflict area more strongly than ever. It has often been reassured that it is of utmost importance to define and redefine the scope of masculinity studies, to establish its basic methodology, and maintain a balance between the ambiguity of interdisciplinary studies and objectivity of a scientific field.We have been working on a peer reviewed online journal that will be published biannually in English and that will serve to provide an independent forum for issues of gender, identity and culture, with a particular emphasis on masculinity studies.   Masculinities offers a joint ground for the interdisciplinary and pioneering research in the field of gender and masculinity, necessarily outreaching into arts, literature, history, sociology, philosophy, communications, linguistics, and medicine so as to enable researchers to share their work, discuss  prospective projects, learn from each other, and inspire young scholars.We invite scholarly and critical contributions, including articles, book and film reviews, reviews of the published articles as well as announcements of forthcoming events, conference reports, and information on other matters of interest to gender studies and/or masculinity studies for the inaugural issue to be published in June 2013. The contributions to the journal should be sent to the email address given below as of April 15, 2013 and they may be related (but not limited) to the topics listed below.

We welcome critical voices and diverse perspectives, recognizing the multiple ways magical realism has been developed or reused globally and various reactions to its heritage in Latin American countries connected to its initial boom and elsewhere in world. This year our particular focus is on the 2023 CCLA congress theme ofReckonings and Re-imaginings in Comparative Literature.Magical realism, though connected to various origins, is most associated with the mid-twentieth century Latin American literary (and iconic Gabriel Garcia Marquez). Then it became “the literary language of the emergent post-colonial world” (Bhabha 7). It has been developing ever since as a mode of expressing existence in the worlds marked by both colonial conquest and anticolonial resistance, where “improbable juxtapositions and marvellous mixtures” (Zamora and Faris 76) exist side by side. Magical realism has circulated widely, picked up by authors in formerly colonized nations around the world as well as more recently in the post-communist countries (with authors like Olga Tokarczuk), and adapted to their own, local, representational needs. Today, we can speak of modes like Aboriginal realism and decolonial realism, which draw on certain conventions of magical realism but separate themselves from the Eurocentric binary logics of “magic” and “realism” that it upholds.We would like you to join our on-going discussion of multiple modes of representing, mediating, or distorting the postcolonial worlds that magical realism was initially developed to capture. The question of what has come after magical realism is central to this discussion. We are interested in post-magical realist modes of representation in contemporary media, literature, cinema, and the arts, as well as popular culture.Possible topics for exploration and further discussion are:-       magic(al) realisms (Flores; Roh)-       the marvellous real (Carpentier)-       African and African American magical realism (Cooper; Quayson)-       Indigenous/Aboriginal realisms (Ravenscroft; Maufort)-       Latin American authors, artists, and filmmakers’ rejections of and re-imaginings of magical realism (McOndo or the Crack literary groups, as well as new wave in cinema)-       animistic realisms (Garuba; Quayson)-       decolonial/anticolonial realisms (Ciccariello-Maher)-       magical realism in post-communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe-       postcolonial realisms (Bjerk)-       post-magical realism and worlding-       magical realism as a “global” postcolonial phenomenon (Bhabha, Slemon) or regionally specific-       magical realism versus European realism married to the tropes naturalism or scientism-       interpretations of magical realism as an international commodity or a particular kind of world literature, cinema and television-       magical realism in cultural politics-       magical realisms in/as popular culture.2023 CCLA conference and Congress will take place on May 29-June 1, 2023 at York University in Toronto.

2022-1956-postcolonial-infrastructure,Postcolonial Infrastructure [EXTENDED],https://call-for-papers.sas.upenn.edu/cfp/2022/10/21/postcolonial-infrastructure-extended,"January 31, 2023","Annual Conference of the German Association for Postcolonial Studies (GAPS) University of Konstanz, 18-20 May 2023",gaps2023@uni-konstanz.de,"Extended Deadline: 31 January 2023Mobility systems, urban planning, markets, educational facilities, digital appliances: infrastructure organizes social life, assigns subject positions, and enables or prevents cultural exchange. Yet its powerful role often goes unnoticed as most infrastructure is designed to recede into the half-conscious background of daily life. In recent years, researchers in several fields have begun to uncover the sociopolitical hierarchies and resistant forces at work in the construction, maintenance, transformation, and dismantling of infrastructure. Postcolonial studies has much to contribute to this research—and vice versa.After all, colonization is itself a large-scale infrastructure project. Both historically and systemically, colonization involves the transcultural transfer of military, political, economic, legal, social, and other infrastructure, and the destruction of indigenous infrastructure, in order to establish and maintain power over colonized peoples. As Édouard Glissant remarks, today’s infrastructures are “products of structures inherited from colonization, which no adjustment of parity (between the former colony and the former home country) and, moreover, no planning of an ideological order has been able to remedy.” Scholars in postcolonial studies have therefore begun to analyze infrastructure as a form of “planned violence” (Boehmer and Davies). At the same time, infrastructure can function as a social good that fosters relations and enables alternative forms of sociality. Access to infrastructure thus confers privilege, regulates participation, and erects hierarchies. In the decolonial struggle, infrastructure has therefore emerged as a key site and means of resistance.These infrastructural dynamics require analytic approaches from the humanities, and especially from postcolonial studies, because they unfold centrally on a cultural level. Infrastructure is shaped by specific actors and processes, and it sustains cultural presuppositions, imaginaries, and ideologies. Infrastructure is also a discursive category that confers visibility or invisibility, and can thus establish epistemological hierarchies and undergird material ones. The concept of infrastructure itself emerged in France at the peak of European imperialism and first spread in anglophone military discourse. At the same time, there are comparable concepts in languages and cultures around the world whose knowledge might modify, challenge, or interrelate with anglophone conceptions of infrastructure.The 2023 GAPS conference seeks to explore this underrepresented yet essential dimension of colonial, postcolonial, and decolonial life. Proposals may address, but are not limited to, issues such as:infrastructures of (post)colonial literature / literature about (post)colonial infrastructurelanguage as infrastructure / infrastructures of languagethe uses of infrastructure in postcolonial and decolonial theoryracialized infrastructureinfrastructure and identitytrans/national infrastructure; cross/border infrastructuresinfrastructures of empireimperial and colonial entanglements of the infrastructure conceptthe temporality of post/colonial infrastructuresthe political aesthetics of infrastructuresinfrastructure and travel (writing)infrastructural genres / genre as infrastructuretranslating infrastructure / infrastructures of translationinfrastructural imaginariesteaching postcolonial infrastructure (within educational infrastructure)rethinking postcolonial studies infrastructurally: which linguistic, literary, formal, theoretical, artistic, social, etc. phenomena can productively be described as infrastructural?Conference participants might be interested in attending the annual Wolfgang Iser Lecture on the night before the conference (17 May 2023) which will be held by Homi K. Bhabha and is co-sponsored by GAPS. Attendance is free of charge.Please submit your 250-300 word abstract byJanuary 31, 2023togaps2023@uni-konstanz.de. All presenters must be GAPS members by the time of the conference.Work in progress in anglophone postcolonial studies—including M.A./M.Ed., PhD, and Postdoc projects as well as ongoing research projects in general—can be presented in the “Under Construction” section of the conference, for which poster presentations are also welcome. Please submit abstracts for project presentations (250-300 words) indicating your chosen format (paper or poster) by March 1, 2023.A limited number of travel bursaries are available for emerging scholars, part-time, or currently unemployed speakers who are, or will become, members of GAPS. If you wish to apply for a travel bursary, please indicate so via e-mail to the conference organizers by March 1, 2023.GAPS strives to create a conference in which everyone can participate in critical discussions of all topics.

2010-1961-the-narrator,The Narrator Nick's Quest in The Great Gatsby: The Rebirth of a Monomyth Hero,https://call-for-papers.sas.upenn.edu/cfp/2010/06/16/the-narrator-nicks-quest-in-the-great-gatsby-the-rebirth-of-a-monomyth-hero,,Fu-yu Cheng,rich33rs@pchome.com.tw,"K27981014 (Fu-yu Cheng)Jun. 16, 2010The Narrator Nick's Quest in The Great Gatsby: The Rebirth of a Monomyth HeroAcknowledgementsI cannot be too grateful to my advisor, Professor Kai-ling Liu, who takes great pains to instruct me how to become a critical writer. In the first year studying for the master's degree, I am not familiar with critical writing. Luckily, Prof. Kai-ling Liu teaches us the course called ""Academic Writing"" during the second semester. Like the monomth hero, I leave the familiar world of my daily life for the unknown word of the academic field, hoping for finding the wonder of knowledge. When writing and correcting this article, I encounter a lot of difficulties. For example, I misuse the critic's opinion as my evidence or I quote some words without addressing it. However, like the supernatural mentor in the monomyth, Professor Kai-ling Liu bestows assistance on me. She helps me conquer the difficulties of writing this article. I have improved a lot in writing. Because of my average intelligence, I wonder whether I have the ability to contribute my article to the reader. Despite of this, I still want to thank Professor Kai-ling Liu for her unrelenting instruction.AbstractThe purpose of this study is to examine the narrator Nick Carraway's heroism and his spiritual development. Nick is a hero because he can conquer the inner trials, redress his deficiencies, and benefit the society. Lots of books, journals and dissertations have discussed The Great Gatsby written by Francis Scott Fitzgerald (1896-1940). The discussions cover a wide range of fields: myth, culture, history, the American dream, structure, style, strategies, the author's biography and adaptations of the novel. This paper deals with the topic of the monomyth hero and the double. I hold that Nick's heroism is demonstrated in his inward and altruistic quest and that the double Gatsby induces Nick to awaken.My thesis declares that Nick's quest leads him to confront his double and secure an epiphany. I use the rites of passage--separation, initiation, and return—based on Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces to explore Nick's spiritual rebirth. In the introduction, I summarize Nick's heroism and present my thesis. Part One examines Nick's journey from the known to the unknown, causing him to encounter his double Gatsby and scrutinize his life force. Part Two focuses on Nick's initiation from ignorance to knowledge and on his spiritual transformation. Part Three discusses both Nick's return from the corrupted to the spiritual and his resurrection. In the conclusion, I claim that the narrator Nick is a monomyth hero undergoing the rites of passage: separation, initiation, and return and that we readers can appraise Nick's quest and inspect our double Nick through his narration and illumination.IntroductionThe Great Gatsby, written by Francis Scott Fitzgerald (1896-1940), uses Nick Carraway narrating his adventure in the East and shows his epiphany. The narrator Nick is intrusive and reflective. Nick not only recounts the protagonist Jay Gatsby's romantic quest for his beloved girl Daisy but involves himself in the story. Through Gatsby, Nick sees his doppelganger and learns his limitations of romanticism. On the other hand, Gatsby is also Nick's ideal ego: Nick appreciates Gatsby's idealism and condemns the capitalism. According to Roger Lathbury, it is not Nick but Gatsby that demonstrates the courage in the war fields (63). This fearless courage leads Gatsby to pursue Daisy undauntedly and thus proves him a hero. Gatsby is a hero of romance. Gatsby is a romanticist. While Gatsby's quest is outward and egoistic, Nick's quest is inward and altruistic. Nick is also a hero, who can conquer the inner trials, correct his deficiencies, and benefit the society. Nick can overcome his surroundings and find his identity and autonomy. Although numerous attempts have been made by scholars to show Gatsby's heroism, only few attempts have so far been made at Nick's heroism. Nick's heroism results from his spiritual quest and rebirth. Thus, I try to argue that Nick's quest leads him to confront his double and secure an epiphany.In this essay, I argue that The Great Gatsby is a cautionary tale about Nick's quest based on observing his double Gatsby. ""Nick is the hero of the novel"", states Jerome Thale ""Gatsby is a fact, the fact, in his development"" (71). Through observing Gatsby, Nick grows in his spiritual development. From Gatsby, Nick learns his ignorance and limitations in romanticism and becomes mature after the end of the story. I use the theory of the monomyth hero in Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces to foreground Nick's spiritual transformation when he experiences ""the rites of passage: separation-initiation-return"" (30). The word ""monomyth"" originates from the novel of James Joyce, Finnegans Wake. Campbell holds that in different times and regions any monomyth hero shares some fundamental structures and stages: A hero leaves his familiar world for an unknown world where he encounters lots of challenges, wins a victory, and returns ""with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man"" (30). Through examining the double Gatsby's actions in the East, Nick's quest is successful because he gets over trials of materialism and brings the ""boons,"" his awakening, for readers.Part One: The Hero's Journey from the Known to the UnknownNick's leaving the West, his hometown, for the East indicates that he undergoes the stage of Campbell's ""separation"": the hero's departure from his familiar homeland into ""a region of supernatural wonder"" (30). The East is the fantastic world full of challenges and adventures. In the East, Nick will meet with Gatsby, Daisy, Tom, Jordan, and Myrtle and the reaction of these people to him will make different impacts on his perspective in life. Rather than ""the warm center of the world,"" declares Nick, ""the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe"" (4). The West, dull and insipid, loses charm for Nick. Nick's leaving for the East explains that he is full of romanticism and that he desires the East to give him opportunities to make a fortune and to live a romantic life. The time when Nick is invited to attend a party and to meet the mysterious Gatsby displays the monomyth hero's call to adventure (Campbell 49). This call means that Nick is summoned by Fate to face his double Gatsby. According to Campbell, the monomyth hero's ""spiritual center of gravity"" is altered ""from within the pale of his society to a zone unknown"" (58). Prior to this invitation, the world of Nick is mundane and common, but due to Fate's arrangement, Nick steps into an unknown world. Nick is obsessed with Gatsby.  Gatsby is an enigma full of wonders and he lives ""like a young rajah in all the capitals of Europe— Paris, Venice, Rome—collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting a little, things"" (42). Gatsby's identity is a mystery to Nick. Likewise, Nick does not know his true identity. Is Nick a romanticist or a realist? Due to this encounter, Nick enters an unknown world of Gatsby's obsession with Daisy. In Gatsby's world, Nick finds that Gatsby is romantic. Because of Gatsby's ""illusion"" filled with ""the colossal vitality"" and ""beyond everything"" (61-2), Nick is amazed. Nick is fascinated by Gatsby's incredible fantasy, having unseen and uncommon energy in the ordinary world. Gatsby's staggering energy reveals Nick's repressed vital energy. From this viewpoint, we may say that Gatsby is Nick's alter ego or even Nick's ideal ego and that Gatsby's world represents Nick's wishful one. Therefore, Nick's journey from the West to the East causes him to face his double Gatsby and to examine his life force.Nick's attending Gatsby's party and arranging a meeting with Daisy and Gatsby signifies the monomyth hero's ""crossing of the first threshold"" (Campbell 77). Nick steps into the world of adventure, away from ""the limits of the hero's present sphere, or life horizon"" (Campbell 77). The moment he departs from his present monotonous circumstances, Nick begins to embark on his quest. This quest is beyond his circumstances and ""[b]eyond them is darkness, the unknown, and danger"" (Campbell 77). Nick braves the dark side of humanity; he struggles with his unknown desires; and he challenges the danger which can undermine his romanticism and idealism. Gatsby's world is the embodiment of Nick's adventure. Nick knows nothing about Gatsby's true identity. Gatsby symbolizes ""darkness, the unknown, and danger,"" to Nick. The gossip ""'[Gatsby]'s a bootlegger'"" (39) denotes darkness; ""'it's more that he was a German spy during the war'"" (29) denotes the unknown; ""'Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once'"" (29) and ""' One time he killed a man'"" (39) denote danger. All these things make it clear that Nick steps into the threshold of adventures to dare his double Gatsby and correct his deficiencies.Part Two: The Hero's Initiation from Ignorance to KnowledgeNick's initiation from ignorance to knowledge follows after he arranges a meeting for Gatsby and Daisy. After the meeting, Nick meets with a series of adventures during the interaction among Gatsby, Daisy, Tom, and Jordan. Stepping into the threshold, the monomyth hero ""moves in a dream landscape . . . where he must survive a succession of trials"" (97). The adventures usher Nick into the road of the trials--the inhumane commodification and the siren-like temptation of American capitalism. Nick steps into the heart of darkness: human values are degraded and materialized; moral order, distorted and undermined. The scenes he experiences are apparently dreamy but actually realistic. Hence, this stage tests the monomyth hero's initiation: if Nick can survive a series of trials, he will grow and win knowledge; if he cannot, he will succumb to materialism and be clouded with ignorance.Corrupted by materialism, the people Nick encounters illuminate his ignorance and grants him knowledge. In Daisy, Nick senses her shallowness and unworthiness. Daisy's words ""'I'm p-paralysed with happiness'"" (8) reveals that her marriage is for security, not for love and her life lacks substance. Lois Tyson reckons that in Tom, Nick sees that Tom obtains Myrtle by using his money and social rank (67). Both Daisy and Myrtle exchange their bodies for their material desires. Besides, in Daisy, Nick sees the sign of commodification that ""she lets Gatsby take the blame for Myrtle's death, while she beats a hasty retreat with Tom"" (Tyson 69). Daisy uses Gatsby as a scapegoat for her misdeed and returns to Tom for protection. In Gatsby, Nick even sees the cold-blooded commodification, using criminal means to accumulate Gatsby's wealth (Tyson 72). Gatsby regards people as commodities and will sacrifice them to reach his goal. Gatsby even offers Nick ""a nice bit of money"" through ""a rather confidential sort of thing"" (53) for the meeting with Daisy. Rife with capitalism, Gatsby tries to use illegal money to acquire Nick's friendship. All these things make it clear that we can elicit Richard Lehan's comment, ""a certain cultural materialism (embodied in Tom Buchanan) exhausting a romantic energy (embodied in Gatsby) leaving us a physical residue (embodied in George and Myrtle Wilson and the Valley of Ashes)"" (110). In a word, Nick awakens that Tom's capitalism languishes Gatsby's romantic strength and that there is nothing left but a land of moral deterioration in the East.Jordan represents the temptress for the monomyth hero Nick; she is attractive but lethal. In Jordan Baker, Nick sees her dishonesty and the behavior of careless driving. Like Daisy's fatal attraction to Gatsby, the siren Jordan holds irresistible attraction to Nick. However, Kathleen Parkinson notes that a contrast to Gatsby's total fascination with Daisy, Nick's reaction to Jordan is both attraction and repulsion (77). As Parkinson points out, ""Nick's response to Jordan's sexual attractiveness is countered by his critical awareness of her ethical limitations"" (78). Nick is fascinated by Jordan's attraction but he can see through her immorality and watch out for it. Jordan's dishonesty and indifference is the deadly temptation to Nick's morality. When they arrive at the Buchanan house after Myrtle's death, Tom asks Nick and Jordan to have supper, Jordan accepts the asking and asks Nick whether he will come in the house. Nick rejects the invitation. It is at this crucial moment that Nick's rejection of Jordan's proposal represents his rude awakening and his disapproval of her ethical morality. Nick cries out of the dim recesses of his mind, ""I'd be damned if I'd go in; I'd had enough of all of them for one day, and suddenly that included Jordan too"" (91). Nick rejects the temptation of the temptress exhibits his victory over his ignorance and weakness, paving the path to knowledge. In terms of the monomyth hero's reaction to the temptress, Campbell affirms that the hero ""of the life beyond life must press beyond her, surpass the temptations of her call, and soar to the immaculate ether beyond"" (122). Only when Nick pursuing his autonomy in his life conquers his weakness can he elevate his morality. The elevated morality helps Nick overcome Jordan's siren-like temptation, avoiding collusion with her. Nick's overcoming Jordan's fatal seduction and avoiding committing the moral sin displays his spiritual growth. Parkinson maintains that ""Nick identifies with Gatsby's romantic passion rather than Jordan's opportunistic form of realism"" (80). From Gatsby's passion for the ideal goal, Nick finds his own hidden passion yearning for happiness, which surpasses Jordan's unsympathetic worldliness. Despite Jordan's attractiveness, Nick overpowers the bewitchment of the temptress Jordan, proceeding the passage from ignorance to knowledge.Nick's sympathy with Gatsby starts when noticing that Gatsby shoulders the blame of Myrtle's death, for the sake of the unconditional love for Daisy. This sympathy leads Nick to enter the stage of the monomyth hero's ""apotheosis"" (Campbell 149). As Campbell claims, ""'The Lord Looking Down in Pity'… regards with compassion all sentient creatures suffering the evils of existence"" (149-50). In this stage, like ""The Lord Looking Down in Pity,"" Nick is filled with compassion for the suffering people. Nick thinks it is a pity that Gatsby ""had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream"" (103). Neil Heims proclaims that ""Gatsby bears a noble sensibility"" (59). Gatsby is noble because of ""his incorruptible dream"" (98). It is Gatsby's pure dream that Nick admires. Nick admires Gatsby for his willing to sacrifice everything, including his life, for his golden girl Daisy. On the night of Myrtle's death, Nick observes that Gatsby is ""clutching at some last hope"" (94). Gatsby still hopes that Daisy will leave Tom and live with him. Although Nick knows that Daisy will desert Gatsby, Nick can not ""bear to shake him free"" (94). Nick is not hardhearted enough to disillusion Gatsby. Although Scott Donaldson calls Nick is a ""snob"" (131), who doesn't like people and who is judgmental, Nick is actually not a snob any longer. Nick is not cold-blooded and detached any more. Instead, Nick sympathizes with Gatsby's sufferings and blames the reality. As Gary Scrimgeour alleges, ""Marlow ends up loathing Kurtz, Carraway . . . is not disgusted by Gatsby but by the mysterious 'foul dust that floated in the wake of his dream'""(492). Unlike the narrator Marlow who does not identify with Kurtz, Nick pities Gatsby's idealism shattered by the cruel reality. It is the cruel reality that Nick denounces. This understanding the alter ego Gatsby indicates that Nick also discovers his own limited romanticism: his deserting the warm West for the illusory East. Accordingly, Nick is not merely proud of his honesty. Sympathy and understanding flood Nick and transform himself into a mature person. After Gatsby is killed by George Wilson, Myrtle's husband, because of Tom's manipulation, Parkinson notices that despite Gatsby's shortcomings and despite Gatsby's death, Nick still tries to reach Daisy and asks others to come to the funeral and ""he is relying upon a common fund of feeling, not merely of decency, but of compassion—a sense that human life has a value, even in death"" (118). Nick's sympathy for Gatsby manifests that Nick appreciates Gatsby's efforts for reaching his dream and that this efforts is worthy of praise and emulation. Instead of ""[disapproving] him from beginning to end"" (98), Nick understands and sympathizes with Gatsby's devotion of ""committ[ing] himself to the following of a grail"" (95). Nick's disapproval is replaced by his appreciation of Gatsby's unwavering searching for the goal. Gatsby's devotion exhibits that Gatsby is Nick's ideal ego. In Nick's mind, it is a pity that Gatsby's American dream is polluted by the East's capitalism. Nick's sympathy for Gatsby discloses that the monomyth hero has accomplished his transformation from a snob to a person of compassion.Part Three: The Hero's Return from the Corrupted to the SpiritualNick's return demonstrates the third passage of the monomyth hero's adventure-- the hero's return to his homeland, bestowing knowledge on the society (Campbell 193). Nick's knowledge is derived from the story of the double Gatsby contaminated by the East. This knowledge is Nick's awakening. When he awakens that the East defiles Gatsby's true greatness, the pure idealism, ""beyond [his] eyes' power of correction"" (112), Nick decides to return to the West. For Nick, the East is a wasteland beyond human redemption. After his return, with knowledge, Nick narrates the story about Gatsby, hoping to enlighten the society.1 Nick's narration proves that he becomes a person of wholeness, mature and responsible. Nick feels that he wants ""the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention for ever"" (3). In other words, Nick feels that the world is being corrupted by capitalism and that he hopes to upgrade the morality in the world by narrating the story. As Peter L. Hays states, the story ""is a savage indictment of the corruption of the American dream"" (174). With the American dream, Gatsby possesses inexhaustible potential and he becomes noble; however, influenced by commercialism, Gatsby employs the wrong methods to achieve his goal. Although noticing Gatsby's deficiencies, Nick foregrounds Gatsby's greatness--""an extraordinary gift for hope"" (3). The gift is that Gatsby has the firmest belief in achieving his hope by making efforts. Gatsby believes that only when he accumulates fortunes can he retrieve the golden past and regain Daisy to live in a paradise happily and ever after. Understanding Gatsby's belief leads Nick to have a rude awakening. Nick awakens that the belief in fulfilling any dream is inspiring and that idealism can be thwarted temporarily but the hope of building a paradise is never destroyed forever. Because of this illumination, in the scene of finishing breakfast with Gatsby and preparing to leave, Nick shouts to Gatsby, saying ""'They're a rotten crowd . . . You're worth the whole damn bunch put together'"" (98). Daisy, Tom, Jordan are polluted by commercialism, so they become cruel and selfish, without any idealism to struggle for. However, Gatsby is not selfish because he is willing to die for Daisy and Gatsby is great because he clings to idealism, pursuing his goal undauntedly. Through the ideal ego Gatsby, Nick notices his own idealism. Besides, Nick comprehends that ""Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams"" (4). That is to say, what is to blame is not Gatsby's aspiration but the degenerate morality in the society. Furthermore, Gatsby's death symbolizes the death of Nick's old self and engenders Nick's salvation and resurrection. Indeed, Gatsby's death and greatness lets Nick  notice the East's corruption and regenerate his wholeness; furthermore, Gatsby becomes an ideal ego who guides Nick to return to the West to pursue his idealism and to present his epiphany to the society.Nick's crossing the return threshold happens when he reflects on the East, which becomes a moral wasteland. Enchanting as it is, the East symbolizes a cultural materialism, exhausting Gatsby's endless romantic energy. The East even threatens to corrupt Nick's romanticism, morality and idealism. ""The first problem of the________________________________________________1 Some critics, like Peter L. Hays, consider Nick unreliable. However, whether Nick is a reliable narrator does not influence his intention to give the society a moral lesson.returning hero,"" Campbell states, ""is to accept as real . . . the passing joys and sorrows, banalities and noisy obscenities of life"" (218). Nick must admit that the experience in the East, joyful or sorrowful, is reflected in the true life. Not until he accepts the harsh reality does Nick gradually recover the trauma rendered by the East. Nick thinks Tom and Daisy morally depraved because they ""smash up things and creatures and then retreat back into their money or their vast carelessness"" (114). Immoral and careless, Tom and Daisy do not reveal the true murderer of Myrtle's death and immediately go abroad, letting others handle the mess. Getting friends with immoral people will make Nick become immoral. It is found that Nick's return from the East to the West signifies his regression to the Eden before the Fall, to the simplicity of American dream without the contamination of capitalism before the World War One. My conclusion is that Nick's return and transformation is beneficial to his morality and also to us readers: Nick recovers from his trauma and regress to an ideal world to dwell in; at the same time, readers can be illuminated to tell from what is moral and what is immoral.In the end, Nick knows the difference between the East and the West and he  represents the monomyth hero becoming the ""master of the two worlds"" (Campbell 229): he is comfortable and competent in both the inner and outer worlds as well as the spiritual and the material. Gatsby's dream is defeated by the indifferent world because of his adolescent illusion; by contrast, Nick's survives because of his psychological disillusionment. Like Goethe's Faust, Gatsby is destroyed by the temptation of the evil power. But Nick resists the temptation. Nick sees through the corrupted world and the spiritual one; he can retrieve Gatsby's idealism and fulfills it in his society. Thus, Nick ""felt that [he] wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention for ever"" (3). Nick wants the world to have the suitable moral standard. It is Nick's responsibility to reorganize the moral order in his society because he understands the destructive power of the material and the nurturing power of the spiritual. Parkinson argues that Gatsby is ""Nick's alter ego who succumbed to the power of wealth to construct a world of beauty"" but Nick ""offer[s] a synthesis of the wasteland and the beautiful dream within a perspective of life"" (118). Gatsby is Nick's double who cannot resist the temptation of wealth; in contrast, Nick can synthesize the corrupted and the spiritual by recounting the story to readers. At the end of the story, Nick realizes that romanticism has its limitations in the real world  of capitalism. To avoid being like his doppelganger Gatsby corrupted by the East, Nick decides to return to the West for spiritual regeneration. Nick's return demonstrates that the lost past cannot be found in the East because of its corruption. However, Nick believes that he can find and create the lost world of romance in the West. Nick believes that the lost innocence can be retrieved by idealism. Moreover, Campbell proclaims that when the monomyth hero returns, he will have ""the power to bestow boons on his fellow man"" (30). Ruth Prigozy also asserts that ""[Nick] has salvaged Gatsby's dream for the reader to consider"" (119). Nick's narration of Gatsby's dream lets us readers ponder our double and the moral lesson. Thus, when he returns from the East, after recovering the trauma caused by the East, Nick can meliorate the society and readers by story-telling. As Robert Ornstein notes, while Gatsby uses the power of wealth to build a mansion desiring to reclaim Daisy, who corrupts him in the long run, the narrator Nick, like Fitzgerald, uses the power of narration to build an ideal ""place of warmth and stability"" (59). The ideal place is the lost past with moral order and humanity. This place is not like Gatsby's world because Gatsby lives in a world of illusion. The world of illusion illuminates Nick and renders himself mature, his narration teaching readers a valuable lesson: both evaluating romanticism and believing in idealism make a person master the two worlds without and within.ConclusionOverall, Nick's perceiving the destructive power of the material in the East and the nurturing power of the spiritual in the West results in his spiritual rebirth. This perception leads Nick to the epiphany: Although the green light ""eluded us then, but that's no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch our arms farther"" (115). Despite the fact that we cannot obtain our goal because of the reality and capitalism, we readers holding idealism can retrieve and recreate the green light, our paradise, and our limitless possibilities. Idealism inspires us to make untiring efforts. Due to this epiphany, Nick transforms himself from an immature adolescent into a mature adult. As a result, Nick decides to return to his homeland, because he recognizes the difference between the East and the West: the former is a wasteland, demolishing his romanticism; the latter, a spiritual paradise nurturing his idealism. Moreover, Gatsby's defeat induces Nick to find out that his innocence is stained by capitalism of the East and that he must return to the West to nurse his idealism by narrating his adventure to readers. We readers, receiving the gift of Nick's moral narration and evaluation, will appraise our experiences in life's progress in a new perspective. Nick's quest is Everyman's. As Nick is a monomyth hero, so are we readers. In conclusion, I claim that the narrator Nick is a monomyth hero undergoing the rites of passage: separation, initiation, and return and that we readers can appraise Nick's quest and inspect our double Nick through his narration and illumination.Works CitedCampbell, Joseph.

2009-4141-short-story,Short Story Analysis: Irony and Why I Live at the P.O.,https://call-for-papers.sas.upenn.edu/cfp/2009/11/20/short-story-analysis-irony-and-why-i-live-at-the-po,,Lindsay Toppert,lindsay.toppert@gmail.com,"Short Story Analysis: Why I Live at the P.O.Why I Live at the P.O. was written by Eudora Welty, born in 1909 and passed away from pneumonia in 2001, in Jackson, Mississippi. During the Great Depression Welty worked as a photographer. Her inspiration behind writing Why I Live at the P.O. came from a photograph she took of a woman ironing in the back of a small post office. Sister, the first-person narrator, in the short story Why I Live at the P.O., causes external conflicts within her family as a result of her inner-conflicts, such as lack of self-confidence and a demanding need to be the center of attention. It is because of these conflicts she deals with inside herself that she is prompted to move out of her families home and into the post office. As Sister tells her side of the story, the reader has sympathy for her as she describes how her younger sister, Stella-Rondo, turned her family against her. However, her pretentious characteristic unconsciously modifies her situation to humorous. Why I Live at the P.O. is a categorized as a dramatic monologue that takes a formalist approach, with an emphasis on irony. Sister constantly insists that her feelings be consider but the family, but ""throughout the story Sister shows that she is incapable of feeling compassion toward her family, while ironically she accuses her family of not showing proper empathy"" (Sexton 1). Sister defeats herself by letting her inner-conflict lash out on her family causing external tension and quarrels among her family.In Why I Live at the P.O. the dynamics of the family change when youngest daughter, Stella-Rondo returns home to China Grove, Mississippi from a failed marriage with Mr. Whitaker and brought home a two year old daughter named Shirley T. Stella-Rondo claims that Shirley T. is adopted and everyone except Sister believes her. Sister shows her strong stand in her idea that Shirley T. is not adopted by saying Mama ""couldn't convince me though she talked till she was blue in the face"" (Welty 486). Mama defends Stella-Rondo by stating; ""I prefer to take my children's word for anything when it's humanly possible"" (Welty 487).  Sister's previous relationship with Mr. Whitaker and her insistence that Shirley T. is Stella-Rondo's daughter, and not adopted sparks up some problems, and from the start of Sister's side of the story, ""she means to convince us that all problems caused in the house can be traced to the arrival of Stella-Rondo"" (Sexton 1). However, the real source behind the tension and deceit between Sister and Stella-Rondo is due to Sister no longer being the focus and center of the family's attention.As a result to Sister wanting to be back in the spotlight she resorts to childish deceit. ""Sister tries to ingratiate herself to her family by using Stella-Rondo's untimely return as the catalyst for her diatribe. However, Sister's words backfire as Stella-Rondo uses them against her"" (Bouton 201).  Stella-Rondo is not dealing with conflict within herself, so it is easier for her to stand up against Sister and use small tactics to bring her down since she already has low self-confidence. Throughout conversation among the family upon Stella-Rondo's return, Sister frequently interjects her input with pernicious intent. ""While the rest of the family either humors or ignores Sister's comments, Stella-Rondo challenges her"" (Bouton 202).  It is at this point in the story when her family and the reader no longer sympathize with Sister. Since sister is the storyteller she is able to summarize her side of the story instead of using dialogue. By using internal monologue to convey to the readers what is taking place denies the audience ability to see her real intentions behind her malicious acts. Sister being the storyteller sets her up to be able to win over her family, but she lets her own machinations triumph over her. Sister is able to create herself and dictate the outcome of the story being the narrator, which is ironic because in the end Sister does not come out on top and in favor of the family. She becomes isolated and rejected by her family. Her characteristics of having low self-esteem, dire need for attention, and being confrontational make her vulnerable to Stella-Rondo's more manipulative personality.Looking past the light, comedic plot, the reader can interpret the deeper themes that hit on the common tensions that can occur between family and the nature of self-independence. Two emotions that help simplify life while living among a society are emotions that Sister ironically lacks, empathy and compassion; yet she claims that everyone in her family is cruel to her. ""As Stella-Rondo steals her audience, Sister jumps through unbelievable hoops to make this story hers"" (Bouton 205). There are times in society when everyone goes to unbelievable lengths to be noticed and heard. Sister goes to such a length that she decides to move out of the house and into the Post Office in her search for once again being the center of attention. Sister's struggle within herself is what pushes her to the point of striving for independence, yet it is ironic that ""Sister's arrangement for independence [was] in the aftermath of her family's Independence Day"" (Whitaker 116). Mama reveals that she is surprised in the situation through stating, ""to think that a family of mine should quarrel on the Fourth of July, or the day after, over Stella-Rondo leaving old Mr. Whitaker and having the sweetest little adopted child! It looks like we'd all be glad"" (Welty 490).  The Fourth of July is seen as a time of celebration, and you would think it would be an even bigger celebration because of Stella-Rondo returning home, but Sister lets her pride and internal struggles stand in the way. Sister proves to her family her sincerity of living at the Post Office when she says, ""But here I am, and here I'll stay. I want the world to know I'm happy"" (Welty 491).  Sister can hope to convince her audience that she is happy living alone, however, ""as an attention-seeker, she will not be content living in isolation for very long"" (Bouton 205). Instead of giving off the impression that she would like people to imply of being happy and content, ""Sister becomes a pedagogue, if only by negative example, from the post-office window, denouncing familial pleasantries and obfuscations"" (Whitaker 117).Work Cited Page:Bouton, Reine Dugas ""The Struggle for Agency in Eudora Welty's 'Why I Live at the 	P.O.'""

George Woodcock, an author on the life and work of George Orwell, claims that 1984 is a revolutionary piece of literature that addresses the crucial issues of our era (17). However, the assertion that 1984 is a “revolutionary piece” can be problematic as it ties the novel to the notion that it solely deals with important issues, and thus, it cannot be flawed due to its revolutionary nature.This binding perception limits the ability to critically evaluate the work, potentially leading to the overlooking of significant issues within the book. Babara Ehrenreich, an author whose writing focuses on social and political issues, confirms this belief in her rationale that assigning the label of “revolutionary” to a literary work often leads to the perception that it is beyond criticism. This can pose a problem as it discourages readers from critically analyzing and evaluating the work (29). One can observe a notable flaw in George Orwell’s employment of character foils between Julia and Katherine in 1984. While character foils can be a powerful literary tool to develop themes and create contrast, the juxtaposition between Julia and Katherine in 1984 is problematic as Orwell portrays the characters in a manner that objectifies them as women. By depicting Julia as sexually promiscuous and rebellious, while portraying Katherine as frigid and uninterested in sex, Orwell perpetuates the notion that women are bound to their sexuality. Although Orwell’s implementation of character foils in 1984 is problematic, this flaw has been disregarded due to the novel’s status as a classic. Nevertheless, a closer examination of how the novel treats these women reveals the restraints of Orwell’s methods and illuminates  the need for a more nuanced portrayal of women in literature. A critical evaluation of the portrayal of female characters in the novel is crucial for a comprehensive analysis of its literary merit. The objectification of women and the restriction of female agency in the novel reflect larger societal issues of misogyny prevalent at the time of the book’s writing and today. Therefore, while acknowledgingthe novel’s contribution to the dystopian genre, it is necessary to examine the depiction of these women, which poses the question of ‘How does George Orwell’s portrayal Julia and Katherine's contrasting attitudes reveal the ways they are oppressed and objectified as women in 1984?’To answer this, the portrayal of Katherine and Julia as foils in Orwell’s work was examined through a feminist lens to analyze the employment of various literary techniques and how they contribute to the objectification of these characters. Further, the usage of secondary sources facilitated the incorporation of multiple perspectives regarding the objectification of Julia and Katherine, thus enabling a more comprehensive analysis of the topic.Throughout 1984 by George Orwell, Winston interacts with two specific women: Julia and Katheirine. These interactions reveal how the divergent attitudes of Julia and Katherine converge in relation to the objectification of women. Julia, Winston’s love interest and sexual partner, is portrayed as sexually liberated but is treated as a sexual object. Katherine, Winston’s ex-wife, is portrayed as a dutiful partner, who exists solely for the purpose of procreation.Orwell objectifies these women, reducing them to passive and sexualized objects. Orwell achieves this, intentional or not, through various literary techniques. Judith Butler, a philosopher and gender theorist, states, “The feminine is thus construsted as a domain of objects, that which is not masculine and hence, not fully human” (29). In essence, Butler argues that many societies have a gender binary that links masculinity with traits like rationality, strength, and autonomy, while femininity is linked with qualities like emotionality, weakness, and dependence. Therefore, the “feminine” is constructed as a realm of objects, rather than as humans with their own autonomy. Orwell’s portrayal of Julia and Katherine in his work reflects this gender binary as he objectifies both women.The organization of this essay centers around an analysis of how Julia and Katherine function as foils to each other. Their divergent attitudes are further examined through a feminist perspective, focusing on the objectification of these characters as a significant aspect of their portrayal. The following analysis argues that, despite their contrasting characterization, both Julia and katherine are subject to the same form of objectification. Through the characters of Julia and Katherine, the pervasive nature of the objectification of women and its  impacts in illustration is acknowledged. Through an examination of their portrayal in George Orwell’s novel 1984, it is apparent that the novel portrays these women as objects or symbols of desire, rather than fully realized individuals with agency and complexity.Julia and Katherine’s contrasting attitudesThroughout the novel, Orwell’s stark and concise diction is embroidered with various literary devices that create a clear depiction of Julia and Katherine’s distinctively different attitudes toward the Party. Kathrine’s conviction to serve the Party is denoted in her affinity to “[make] a baby” (Orwell 67) with Winston as she professes it’s “[their] duty to the Party” (Orwell 67). Orwell portrays Katherine and Winston’s relationship as lacking both intimacy and emotional connection. The phrase “making a baby” is a euphemism for sexual intercourse, and its employment in this context is ironic as in the society of 1984, sex is not intened for pleasure or connection, but solely for procreation and alligiance to the Party. The contrast between “making a baby” and “duty to the Party” emphasizes the conflict between personal desires and obligations to a larger group or cause, thematically highlighting the dehumanizing effects of the Party’s control over its citizens. Furthermore, Winston’s observation of Katherine’s use of the phrase “duty to the Party” foreshadows his later rebellion against the Party’s control over his personal life and relationships. The rigidity of Winston and Katherine’s relationship is exemplified In Winston’s acknowledgment that “as soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffin” (Orwell 66). The phrase “as soon as he touched her” suggests that physical intimacy between Winston and Katherine is rare or infrequent, emphasizing the emotional distance between them. The adverb “seemed” suggests that Winston us not entirely sure of Katherine’s emotional state, highlighting the lack of communication and understanding that characterizes their relationship. The verb “wince” connotes a sudden, involuntary movement, as though Katherine is recoiling from something unpleasant. This suggests that the intimacy that she shares with Winston is not only unwelcome but actively distressing for her, indicating a lack of emotional connection and a sense of disconnect between the two characters. Similarly, the verb “stiffin” suggests a physical response to discomfort, as though Katherine is bracing herself against something that she finds unpleasant. This implies a sense of rigidity and inflexibility in her character, indicating that she is unable or unwilling with the emotional demands of the relationship.While Katherine represents idealized conformity, Julia represents a form of rebellion against the Party. Julia’s declaration of “[adoring]” (Orwell 125) sex and assertion of engaging in sexual intercourse “Hundreds of times--well, scores of times, any-way” (Orwell 125) accentuates her juxtaposition to Katherine. The hyperbole in the line “Hundreds of times--well, scores of times, any-way” serves to convey Julia’s nonchalant disposition towards sex and relationships by exagerating her number of partners. Likewise, the idiom present in Julia’s use of the phrase “any-way” suggests a lack of concern for the specifics of her sexual history, further emphasizing her carefree attitude towards sex, which directly contrasts Katherine’s tense attitude. Moreover, Winston’s declaration of “[hating] purity” (Orwell 125)  and reference to Julia as a “dream” (Orwell 124) entrenches the reader with Winston’s nihilistic reproach for the world. In this context, it is evident that Winston characterizes Katherine through the lens of purity, which is a concept that Julia deliberately subverts. It is notable that the Party idealizes Katherine for her conformity and lack of individuality, while Winston idealizes Julia for her innate agency and self-expression. Julia’s blithe temperament for sex contrasts Katherine’s repressed aversion to such subject matter.This is consistent with J. Meyers’, a writer who has published several articles with a background Marxist and critical theory, findings, which also suggest that the portrayal of Katherine’s conformity to the Party’s norms and lack of independent thought in 1984 reflects the patriarchal nature of the society in which she exists (54). Katherine embodies what Julia is not. Katherine’s aversion to sex and alignment the to the Party’s principles are juxtaposed with Julia’s sexual identity aand rejection of the Party. The narrative portrays Julia as an objectified figure through her portrayal as a sexual entity and her involvement in the Junior Anti-Sex league. The irony is that Julia, who participates in the Junior Anti-Sex League is overtly sexually active, emphasizing her exploitative characterization. While Orwell’s usage of irony does thematically convey the oppressive nature of totalitarian regimes, Julia is restricted to her objectifying characterization; she doesn’t exist beyond her role as a sexual being. In contrast, Katherine is characterized as modest and uninterested in physical intimacy. The portrayal of both characters demonstrates a common thread of objectification, whereby their worth as individuals is reduced to  their physical attributes and sexual identity. Despite their apparent differences in beliefs and behaviors, their portrayal emphasizes the similarity in how both characters are defined and constrained by societal norms and expectations surrounding gender and sexuality.The Thread of ObjectificationThroughout the novel, Julia is objectified through her sexuality and treated as a means of pleasure and rebellion while Katherine is objectified through her appearance and treated as a symbol of the ideal femininity. Katherine and Julia are reduced to objects to be used rather than complex characters with agency over their lives. Orwell’s initial reference to Julia is enriched by descriptive literary devices that sexuallly objectify her. Julia is referenced as a “bold-looking girl of about twenty-seven, with thick dark hair, a freckled face, and swift athletic movements” (Orwell 10) and lusted after for the “shapliness of her hips” (Orwell 10). The adjective “bold-looking” suggests that Julia is confident and assertive; however, her reference to “girl” infantilizes her, emphasizing her youth and suggesting an absence of the maturity. In referring to Julia as girl rather than a women, she is stripped of her autnomy and reduced to a subservient status. She is positioned as a flat character who is bound to her characterization as a sexually percocious girl. Furthermore, the imagery utilized in characterizing her by the “shaplieness of her hips” reduces Julia to an attribute, highlighting her sexuality. By describing her as shapely, Winston is suggesting that Julia is physically desirable. The phrase “shaplieness of her hips” also suggests a certain symmetry and proportionality, indicating that Julia’s figure is aesthetically pleasing. While the implementation of such vivid imagery creates an allusive picture for the reader, Julia is reduced to her physical appearance and treated as a sexual object.As the novel progresses, Winston obsesses over Julia’s characteristics by describing her as “young and pretty and sexless” (Orwell 15). The parallel structure in this phrase is given equal weight and emphasis, which creates a sense of symmetry and balance in the sentence, drawing attention to each individual adjective. In this context, the parallel structure emphasizes Winston’s fixation on Julia’s physical appearance, as well as his idealized and objectifyingview of her as a sexual partner who is innocent in pure. Moreover, the polysyndeton emphasizes Winston’s obsession with Julia’s physical attributes as the repeated conjunction invokes the reader with a sense that he is uttley captivated by her features. Instead of introducing the description with a list, each adjective is separated with a conjunction, which implies spontaneity when compared to a list that insinuatesa certain level of through and thought out action. Orwell’s application of a polysyndeton objectifies Julia in drawing attention to Winston’s obsession with her physical attributes.Orwell’s characterization of Winston’s obsessive attitude in regard to sex further illustrates Julia’s role as a sexual object. Winston’s conviction that sex is “[destroying] virtue” (Orwell 125)  and belief that their “embrace…was a political act” (Orwell 126) reinforces the notion that Winston and Julia’s relationship is entirely physical. The metaphorical language unuderpins the reality that their relationship is not intimate, but a deliberate act of rebellion against the Party. Winston’s lack of regard for Julia and their relationship is apparent in his expectation that she satisfy his desires. Winston’s disregard is amplified in the distinction that he believes their “embrace” was “political act.” Julia is expected to exist as a sexual object for Winson to express his rebellion through. Julia is reduced to an object of desire, devoid of her own self-determination.Although, Colin Sparks, an academic in the field of media and communication studies who has written several articles on media, gender, and power,  interprets Julia as a character to challenge traditional gender roles by rejecting femininity and asserting her sexually agency (59). Sparks neglects to acknowledge that in claiming Julia is “asserting her sexually agency” she is inherently bound to the objectification that Orwell utilized to portray her. Julia is not sexually liberated; her existence is defined by her misogynistic portrayal. Julia exists solely as a means of fulfilling Winston’s sexual desires, rather than as a multifaceted person. Her portrayal prioritizes male domination and further entrenchs the notion that women are solely meant for male gratification. The reduction of Julia to a sexual object reinforces the societal values that privilege male gratification at the expense of female autonomy.Moreover, the third person narrative perspective further sexually objectifies Julia by referencing that “her body gleamed white in the sun” (Orwell 125). Julia’s body is personified as it’s given the ability to gleam, suggesting a kinda of radiance and brilliance. Orwell’s personification of Julia’s body as “[gleaming] white,” emphasizes her physical beauty and attractiveness, reducing her to an object of desire for Winston. The word “white” symbolizes innocence and purity, and the “[gleam]” of her body in the sun highlights her innocence as the sun’s hot heat could only accentuate her perceived chastity. Orwell’s description of Julia’s body as “[gleaming] white” infantilizes her, emphasizing her purity and innocence. The association of whiteness with innocence and purity further reinforces this idea, suggesting that Julia is only valuable as long as long as she remains chaste and innocent. Julia is objectified in the sense that she is treated as a perceived pure object of desire. While narrator’s characterization of Julia contradicts the Winston’s contempt for purity, she is still reduced to an a sexual object. The third person narrative perspective reflects Winston’s attitude towards Julia. His disposition shifts from an emphasis on purity and innocence to an innate disdain for such concepts. Winston’s avowal of “[hating] purity” after his remarks of her perceived innocence construct a clear depiction that Julia exists as an object for Winston. Winston’s initial attraction to Julia is based on her perceived innocence and purity. Despite Julia’s personal sexual identity not conforming to traditional ideals of chastity and modesty. Winston remains fixated on her as he gains a deeper understanding of her. Orwell juxtaposes Julia’s preconceived identity and her actual identity, emphasizing her existence as a sexual object.From the initial reference to Katherine, she is objectified through a variety of literary devices. Katherine is characterized as “a tall, fair-haired girl, very straight, with splendid movements. She [has] a bold, aquiline face, a face that one might have called noble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothing behind it” (Orwell 66). This detailed sensory description of Katherine’s physical appearance emphasizes her outward appearance, rather than her inner thoughts, feelings, or personality. The ironic contrast between the initial impression of Katherine’s “noble” appearance and  the revelation that there is “nothing behind” her face emphasizes the emptiness or hollowness of her character, further reinforcing her objectification as a symbol or stereotype. The metaphor of Katherine’s face as “noble” contributes to her objectification by suggesting that she exists primarily as a decorative or ornamental object, rather than a complex and multifaceted person.Moreover, Katherine is objectified in Winston’s slanderous descriptions of her as a “human soundtrack” (Orwell 66) and his belief that she is “frozen by the hypnotic power of the party” (Orwell 67). Winston’s attitude towards Katherine dehumanizes her, stripping her of her autonomy and individuality. Furthermore, the metaphorical language employed by Winston, referring to Katherine as a “human soundtrack,” highlights his perception of her as a passive entity, existing solely to provide background noise. By likening Katherine to a soundtrack, she is reduced to an object whose value is determined by what she can offer Winston. In addition, the word-choice “frozen” implies that Katherine is unable to act on her own, as though she is held in a state of suspended animation by the hypnotic power of the Party. This metaphorical language suggests that Katherine is not only objectified but stripped of her agency, emphasizing the larger theme of the novel, namely the impact of a dictatorship on individual autonomy. Katherine is portrayed as an object to be used rather than an individual with her own agency.While Julia and Katherine are inherently different, they share significant commonalities. Often, when readers view them as opposing characters, they overlook the areas where their characterization converges. While Julia and Katherine have many contrasting qualities, they also share notable similarities. Both Katherine and Julia are subjected to objectification by the Party and Winston, although in different ways. Katherine is portrayed as the embodiment of the Party’s idealized femininity, reducing to a mere symbol rather than a complex individual. On the other hand, Julia is objectified by Winston, who perceives her as a means to satisfy his own desires rather than a realized person. Despite their differences, both characters are reduced to mere objects by those around them, and their agency and individuality are suppressed. Winston expects Julia to engage in sexual conduct in an attempt to rebel against the the Party, while the Party expects Katherine to engage in sexual conduct in an attempt to bare a child. Maggie Wykes, a writer of several academic articles on gender and language, insists that Julia, as a foil to Katherine, intrinsically resists being reduced to an object and defies the Party’s expectations while Katherine is the embodiment of the Party’s ideal women (303). Conversely, this is true, since arguably Orwell’s implementation of their character foil strategically highlights the contrasting attitudes of both women; however, Orwell’s employment of juxtaposition does exactly that; it highlights Julia’s and Katherine’s differences. By focusing on their differences, Wykes neglects to acknowledge the areas in which Julia’s and Katherine’s characterization overlaps. Winston is not expected to father a child as Katherine is expected to mother a child, and Winston is not expected to perform sexual favors as he expects Julia to entertain his wishes. Julia’s and Katherine’s portrayal embodies the highly embellished roles that women face as their existence in the text does not exceed fulfilling the desires of others. They are characterized as sexual objects meant to be used rather than reasonable characters whose role in the novel is not bound by their sexual nature.Although, Andrew McNicol, an author and lecturer in English Language and Literature at the University of Bedfordshire, offers a different perspective on this matter. McNicol asserts that Orwell intentionally objectifies the major characters in 1984 to highlight the novel’s thematic concerns and reinforce its commentary on the dehumanizing effects of totalitarianism (35). On the other hand, McNicol’s assertion holds some validity, given that Orwell’s novel functions as an allegorical depiction of the emergence of totalitarian regimes; however, upon closer examination, the instances of objectification experienced by Winston and O’Brien, two central character who contribute to the plot of 1984, can be attributed to the oppressive nature of the society depicted in the novel. Conversely, the objectification of Julia and Katherine is a result of both their portrayal as female characters in a patriarchal society and the oppressive nature of the society itself.ConclusionIn 1984, Orwell constructs a narrative that portrays women as passive and sexual objects of male desire. Orwell does this through various literary techniques that render the women of the novel lesser than men. Orwell’s portrayal of Katherine and Julia contributes a broader discussion of how this canonical text that does not relate to women specifically depicts women as objects.  Even though Julia and Katherine are counter parts for each other, Orwell objectifies these women. Whether intentional or not, the impact of such portrayal on the reader is significant, especially considering that this work is widely taught to highschool students who are developing their conceptions about gender roles. Because this novel does not pertain to feminism directly, the feminist perspective is often overlooked in coversations regarding the novel as they tend to focus on the dangers of an authoritarian regime, resulting in students who are exposed to misogynistic ideas without critical examination. When examining how these literary techniques contribute to ways in which women are oppressed and objectified, it poses a risk of oversimplifyingthe issue, potentially leading to an oversight of how the women in the novel may resist or subvert these roles. A larger scale comprehensive analysis should also consider the intersectionality of gender with other forms of oppression and marginalization. By acknowledging and accounting for the complexity of these factors, a more nuanced understanding of the impact of Orwell’s portrayal of women on theways in which women are oppressed and objectified.Through analyzing and revealing this misogynistic portrayal of these two women in the novel, this paper comes to the conclusion that Orwell’s character foil of Julia and Katherine in 1984 objectifies both women, despite their intentional juxtaposition. By portraying female characters such as Julia and Katherine in a manner that objectifies them, Orwell’s novel 1984 reinforces and perpetuates negative stereotypes and societal expectations that are harmful to women. This contributes to the fundamental concern of misogyny in society, as it reinforces the notion that women are objects to be controlled and manipulated rather than individuals with their own desires and autonomy. As well, given the employment of Julia and Katherine’s divergent attitudes in this text offers a nuanced perspective on how this depiction equates them to objects, it would be intriguing to delve deeper into the impact of character foils by conducting a comparative literary analysis that incorporates other novels. This type of analysis could offer valuable insights into how authors utilize juxtaposition to convey themes and messages across different literary works. Through examining juxtaposition among 1984 and other novels, one could explore the areas of commonality and contrast in the ways that authors purposefully position contrasting elements to create compelling characters and advance their narratives. Approaching the subject with a comparative lens may offer a more comprehensive understanding of how authors develop characters and relationships in their works. Such analysis may unveil patterns and trends in the usage of character foils across different literary genres and time periods, providing a deeper comprehension of hos this technique has evolved over time. Furthermore, this approach can furnish a framework for discussing how literature areflects and shapes societal attitudes and beliefs about topics such as power, gender, and identity. Regardless, as readers engage with the portrayal of women in Orwell’s 1984, it is imperative to acknowledge the impact of these representations on our wider cultural attitudes towards gender. By actively challenging the perpetuation of harmful societal norms and advocating for more inclusive and diverse representations of women, there is potential to create more equitable and just portrayals.Works CitedButler, Judith.

Her seminal article not only brought together distinct areas of film studies (genre criticism, spectatorial response, taste cultures, gender and sexuality, emotion and sensation in cinema) that are still highly relevant today, but also theoretical frameworks that have traditionally been kept separate. Although grounded in a psychoanalytic model for understanding structures of desire, fantasy, and identification, Williams’ essay at the same time marked a turning point towards a corpus of scholarship that is more attuned to and engaged with the embodied film-viewing experience.We propose returning to “Film Bodies” in light of the exponentially growing scholarly thought on and through horror, pornography, and melodrama in the past twenty years, as well as a renewed interest in the problematics of materiality, perception, feeling and sensation in the wake of the affective turn. We want to explore the ways Williams’ essay still influences current theoretical debates while taking into account more recent perspectives on these—and other—body genres and advances in a number of approaches (cognitivist, phenomenological, affective, and psychoanalytic). As these schools of thought become increasingly polarized, if not antagonistic, we ask if there is a way to combine their insights into a more encompassing critical methodology to open up new avenues of inquiry for film theory.Proposal topics could include but are not limited to:Critical work in horror, porn, and melodrama in conversation with WilliamsOr additional “body” genres that she doesn’t discussThe problem of “grossness” or sensationalism and/as excessIn excess of what? Should we see emotion and sensation as gratuitous?The materiality of the bodily reactions, secretions, and fluids as a basis for genre criticismAffective and embodied viewing practices that highlight the role of our and the films’ “bodies”Spectatorial identification and fantasy along/across/against (?) strictly gender linesMasochistic or sadistic viewing pleasuresMoving beyond a psychoanalytic model for desire and fantasyFeminist film theory in the wake of Williams’ insightsShould we also rethink her models of gender difference and desire as political acts?Distinctions (or lack thereof) between high and low genres and their capacity for political action/criticismHybrid theoretical approaches—combining genre theory, psychoanalysis, affect studies or other methodologiesPlease send abstract (ca. 300 words) plus bibliography (3–5 entries) and author bio (50–100 words) to Dewey Musante and Ella Tucan atdewmusante@gmail.com.

Though U.S. poets and artists were influenced by the formal techniques of Cubism, Futurism, Expressionism, Dadaism and Surrealism, they were also determined to search for the essence of an expressive language that defined its authenticity as opposed to European foreignness. One of their avenues of research was the exploration of the distinctive features of the American soil as a means of contributing novel aspects to modern aesthetics. The genuine character of the environment is closely linked to the strong attachment to rural or urban spaces and the value they acquire for the observer. In this regard, the American Modernists engaged in the project of unearthing the specificity of their native land as a means of defining their national identity. This is noticeable in the group of the Precisionists led by Charles Demuth and Charles Sheeler, who helped poets to see the sense of place and transcribe it in their own words. For instance, William Carlos Williams and Hart Crane took the cityscape painting of Charles Sheeler and Joseph Stella to record urban architecture as part of U.S. culture. In this same vein, Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens and Robert Frost promoted natural spaces in their poetry, just as Arthur Dove, Marsden Hartley and Georgia O’Keeffe gave visibility to regional settings in their artistic production. Abstracts for papers that examine the sense of place underlying the American poetic and visual art are welcome to participate in this session. Topics might include, but are not limited to the following:—The impact of European experimental language on the rise of an American artistic expression rooted in the autochthonous soil of the U.S.—The role of twentieth-century print culture and the press to promote the “Americanness” of Modernism.—The creation of coteries and galleries that raised awareness of the necessity of developing a consciousness for the native land.—Representations of the natural and technical sublime in the U.S.—Ethnicity and the sense of place in the Harlem Renaissance.—The regional poetry of Carl Sandburg, Robert Frost and Wallace Stevens.—Sherwood Anderson’s poetry and the place of an American Indian past.—Urban architecture and industrial landscapes in Precisionist art and the poetry of Williams Carlos Williams.—The local painting of Arthur Dove and Marsden Hartley.—The import of women poets and artists such as Marianne Moore and Georgia O’Keeffe in marketing the American soil.By May 1st, 2017, please submit a 300-word abstract along with a short biography to Leticia Pérez Alonso, Jackson State University, atleticia.p.alonso@jsums.edu.For further information about the conference ""Regionalism and Place in American Literature,"" see the following link:http://americanliteratureassociation.org/ala-conferences/ala-symposia/re...","american, interdisciplinary, international conferences, modernist studies, poetry",2017-04-07,2017,conference,"CONFERENCE, Jackson State University",Jackson State University,United States,American Literature Association (ALA); The College English Association (CEA),,18219.0

Noreña, Professor of History, University of California, BerkeleyEmpire has been a persistent form of human organization and one of the primary mechanisms for the dispersion of cultural forms. Some of the earliest known empires include the great imperial formations in Mesopotamia in the second millennium BCE and in Persia and around the Mediterranean in the first millennium BCE. Over the past two millennia, empires have appeared in all regions of the world, including in the Americas (Tawantinsuyu), Asia (the Mughal Empire, Khmer Empire), Europe (the Austro-Hungarian Empire), Oceania (the Tu’i Tonga Empire), and Africa (the Mali Empire, the Songhai Empire). They have also cut across large swaths of the planet (such as the British, Spanish, and Dutch empires). Although decolonization was a defining historical process of the twentieth century, the expansionist efforts of nation-states today suggest that empire remains a political, military, and economic strategy and a geographic and cultural ambition.For its first conference in Asia, the International Society for Cultural History invites paper and panel proposals on the theme of “Cultural Histories of Empire.” Historians and contextually oriented scholars working on any period or location are encouraged to explore (but are by no means limited to) the following topics:-imperial culture: literature, music, art, religion, sport (cricket, horse racing, rugby, etc.)-iconographies of imperial power-conceptual terminology in the study of empires-forms of resistance to and subversion of imperial authority-inter-imperial commodity chains, trade journeys-nationalistic movements, transitions from empire to nation-state-the embodied experiences of empire-environmental colonialism-everyday empire: street signs, posters, patterns of consumption-the circulation of periodicals and imperial press systems-leisure practices, such as reading, cooking, hiking, and feasts in imperial contexts-performances of colonial authority: ceremonies, hearings, trials, gatherings-popular attitudes toward empire-imperial propaganda: Ara Pacis, literature, public monuments, film, radio, television, rhetoric (“political spin”), etc.-travel writing (memoir, journalism, blogs, letters), adventure fiction-informal empireAs always, we also welcome panel and paper proposals on methods and theories of cultural history; new approaches to cultural history; and the history of cultural history.Presentations should be no more than 20 minutes in length and delivered in English: Individual paper proposals should consist of an abstract (not exceeding 300 words) and an 80-100 word bio in a single Word or PDF file.

2015-0729-comparative-literature,Comparative Literature in India: Contemporary Issues,https://call-for-papers.sas.upenn.edu/cfp/2015/02/19/comparative-literature-in-india-contemporary-issues,,"Centre for Comparative Literature, UNIVERSITY of HYDERABAD",jbheemaiah66@gmail.com,"University of HyderabadHyderabad, Telangana, India – 500046National SeminaronComparative Literature in India: Contemporary Issues18-19 March, 2015CALL FOR PAPERSConcept Note'The comparatist has to know that comparative literature is a method of investigation while world literature is a body of valuable literary works'(Das 96).Despite this, the term 'comparative literature ' remains ambiguous to many practitioners, students and scholars in India, who , one would expect, are familiar with the debate surrounding the discipline because it addresses the crucial issues of pluralism and cultural democracy in the subcontinent. The purpose of this seminar is to specifically address this space, which has existed in a disciplinary formation in India since 1956, but arises, as has been pointed out above, from the plural horizons of culture shared across the continent. The concept of comparative literature in India received an impetus from Rabindranath Tagore's lecture delivered on the subject when he was invited by National Council of Education in 1907. But the idea of Comparative Literature suggested by Das, a practicing comparatist, is different from the idea expressed by Tagore. Studying Indian literature demands a comparative method, and this cannot be substituted by the direct application of any method or theory imported from outside the plural culture in which the literature is located. Hence the 'mainstream' of Comparative Literature practice may have suggestions to offer the Indian comparatist, but the task of finding the method for Comparative Literature in India - not an 'Indian' Comparative Literature, for often enough we may have to question the very basis of methods laid down by the 'mainstream'- lies with us. This would qualify it be an academic discipline.We may place the idea of Comparative Literature in a broader perspective by reading it alongside the 'history' of the discipline elsewhere in the world. As academic discipline it emerged in the recent period. The term 'litteratur comparee' was first used by Villemain, a French scholar in 1829. The Indian situation may be contrasted with these endeavours in that India is multicultural and multi-linguistic. In such scenario, an 'inter-literary condition' used by Amiya Dev to describe Indian literature, is the norm rather than the exception. Since the basic objective of comparative literature is to counteract the hegemony and theprofessed autonomy of national literatures, by shifting the theoretical focus towards plurality and dynamism. We imagine that the minimum requisite of a comparative study is to start with at least two literatures. But as Das has reminded us, Comparative Literature is a method, not an object of study - hence we are interested in how to study literature: how literature, i.e. what we are studying, is created or produced, and how it elicits from us the responses that makes it 'literature' rather than a text of the social sciences. Besides, the binary view, comparing A to B, may not be sufficient to meet the full demand of the study of comparative literatures as several literatures are produced in different languages in all countries as an indivisible whole.Larger part of ancient Indian literature was produced in Sanskrit. The influences or affinities between literatures which have been produced in modern Indian languages in order to project India as one nation could not be studied largely due to inaccessibility of the Sanskrit language to the majority in India but its similitude was found with Persian and Arabic, and Greek and Latin. This should have provided historical guidelines for a comparative practice of pluralism in order to understand the inter-literariness of the Indian literary culture. Warren Hastings, the first Governor General of India, pleaded for a comparative study of Gita and European works of great merit. But is comparison with the west the only criterion for the study of comparative Indian literature? Whether it is language or culture or political boundary that would limit the study to a sole criterion and hence a single perspective, which is against the very ideology of Comparative Literature. Though Indian literature is produced in English, it can't form part of English literature; its study therefore cannot be limited to the English or English-translated critical canon or to the principles of literalization offered by Eastern or European principles and theories alone. Besides, the nesting culture of the English writing in India is quite different from that of English writing in Africa, or Australia or the Americas, or even in other parts of the subcontinent.Marathi and Telugu literature, though written in different languages, share a number of similarities in different respects. The relation of these to Sanskrit has influenced them as much as their relations to the local oratures and language-registers. The incident of colonial rule has influenced different groups of the Marathi and Telugu speaking peoples, in different ways. Common history, 'inherited texts' and similar processes of negotiating with these influences may be said to mark the larger body of 'Indian' literatures. Hence rather than a homogenous 'national' ideal, and rather than a limiting binary between 'nation' and 'vernacular', 'local' and 'global', the pedagogical aim of this seminar is to suggest the comparative method as an alternative means of studying cultural process and product.This situation prompts us to look at our literatures from within and in the context in which they are produced and studied. It also prompts us to turn towards the sources and resources resulting from cultural contact far older than the colonial episode, reflect upon their influences as well as their refiguring in the light of colonial politics and their residual survival in 'post 'colonial modernity. This national conference intends to focus on the politics of thediscipline and theoretical formulations, interrogating its inclination towards western and European thinking and inviting reflection upon the inadequacy of their application to the Indian literary tradition. Its aim therefore is to situate the conversation about theory from 'below' in the context of the contemporary India and suggest pluralism as a conceptual tool to study Indian literary field.Work CitedDas, Sisir Kumar.

Thank you.Twenty-first century media have seen a rise not only in remakes and ‘re-imaginings’, but also transmedia adaptations, works based in nostalgic callbacks, fan-written versions of media, and genre-bending remixes. While a wider body of work exists on transmedia storytelling and adaptation, Gothic horror remakes are still a rich and largely unexplored subject, even as interest in the remake phenomenon continues to grow. And yet, the history of Gothic horror in film and television is rich in re-adaptations, and re-conceptualizations, where the literary roots of Gothic horror tropes, narratives, and characterizations continue to resurface and uncannily return.This edited collection, intended as a volume for Lexington Books/Rowman & Littlefield’s ‘Remakes, Reboots and Adaptations’ series, seeks to address the multi-faceted reincarnations of Gothic horror in contemporary film and television.Gothic Afterlivessets out to say something about who we are, where we’ve come from, and where we’re going, as read in our popular culture and the stories we tell ourselves over and over again.Potential topics include, but are not limited to:-       film and television remakes of iconic Gothic horror figures and texts-       transnational and transcultural remakes of Gothic horror film and television-       hybridity, canon, and genre-bending Gothic horror remakes-       nostalgia and remaking/readapting Gothic horror-       discourses of gender/race/ethnicity/class/national identity in Gothic horror remakes and adaptations-       issues of recycling and stereotyping in Gothic horror-       Gothic horror narratives and historical (in)accuracies-       the literary roots of contemporary Gothic horror media-       Gothic horror remakes and the internet-       Gothic horror remakes/adaptations and fandom-       multimedia Gothic horror remakes and adaptations (games, comic books, and more)Abstracts (300 words max) are due for submission on 28 May 2017.
